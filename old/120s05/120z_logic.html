<h4 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">1. Defining the
term "argument"</h4>
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The word
"argument" has different meanings in different contexts. In
common usage it often means "a verbal dispute," as in "Joe and Ray had
an argument over money." In mathematics it can mean "an independent
variable
in a function." In literature it may refer to the plot of a play or
book.
</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">It is important
to keep in mind that in philosophy, we use
"argument"
somewhat differently. Philosophers, like other people, try to get you
to
believe things: that animals have (or don't have) rights, that we
should
be virtuous,
that the universe consists of minds and ideas and nothing else, and on
and on. To get you to believe something, philosophers give you
reasons--we call them </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">premises</span><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">:
a
set of claims
that are supposed to show you why something (referred to as the </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">conclusion</span><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">) is true. Premises
and
conclusion together make an </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">argument</span><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">.
To give you a precise technical definition:</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<div
 style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">In
Philosophy, an <span style="font-weight: bold;">argument </span>is a
collection of one or
more declarative statements, one of which is called the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">conclusion </span>and the rest of which
are called the <span style="font-weight: bold;">premises</span>.
Ordinarily, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">premises </span>of
an argument are supposed to support, or give us reason(s) for
believing, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">conclusion</span>.
(Whether the premises <span style="font-style: italic;">succeed </span>in
supporting the conclusion is another story. But even if they try to and
fail, the collection is still an argument.)* <br>
</div>
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Sometimes in
philosophical discussions we'll use the term "argument" to
refer just to the premises, as in "You think X?
What's
your argument for that?" Sometimes it refers to the premises plus the
conclusion
they're supposed to get you to believe.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Below you will
find several examples of arguments with their premises
and conclusions neatly labeled. Very often, however, arguments do not
come in such plain form. To understand philosophy&#8212;at least as it is
practiced in this neck of
the woods&#8212;you must find the arguments contained in what philosophers
say
and write. You must, in other words, find what it is they want you to
believe,
and what reasons they're giving you to believe it. It's not that hard
to
do. As you read, just keep asking yourself what the author is trying to
persuade you of&#8212;what is the main point being made? And what reasons are
being offered in favor of it?
</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">And once you
find the arguments, you must then evaluate them; that
is,
check and see whether they're any good. The point of this reading is to
help you identify the two main types of arguments--inductive and
deductive--and give you tips on evaluating them. Because most of the
arguments we will encounter in this course are deductive, we will focus
most on how to evaluate deductive arguments. </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<h4 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">2. Two types of
arguments</h4>
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">To evaluate an
argument, the first thing you need to notice is what
type of argument it is. There are two main types of arguments: </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">inductive
</span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">and </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">deductive</span><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">. First we'll take a
quick
look at </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">inductive
</span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">arguments.
</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Inductive
arguments try to give you
reason to believe that something is probably true, or most likely true.
</span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Here's
an example of an inductive argument: </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<div
 style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Premise
1: This crow is black. <br>
Premise 2: That crow is black.<br>
Premise 3: Every crow I've ever seen is black.<br>
Conclusion: All crows are black. <br>
</div>
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Notice that the
premises of this argument do not prove that its
conclusion is true. Maybe I've only seen one flock of crows in my whole
life! Also notice that we can strengthen the argument by adding more
premises, like this:</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<div
 style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Premise
1: This crow is black. <br>
Premise 2: That crow is black.<br>
Premise 3: Every crow I've ever seen is black.<br>
Premise 4. I've traveled around the world examining crows and only
found black ones. <br>
Premise 5. I've asked everyone I've met, and they've all reported that
all the crows they've seen are black.<br>
Premise 6. I've read every book every published about crows, and they
all say crows are always black.<br>
Conclusion: All crows are black. <br>
</div>
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">But still the
conclusion is not absolutely guaranteed to be true. We
must admit that even if all the premises are true it's still possible
that somewhere there was a white crow, or a yellow one, that nobody
noticed. The conclusion here is at best probably true. </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<h4 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">3. Evaluating
inductive arguments</h4>
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Since they
don't even try to establish that their conclusions are true,
it's pointless to criticize an inductive argument by saying, "That
conclusion's not necessarily true!" That's something we just take for
granted. Rather, we need to consider two things: First, we need to ask
whether the premises are true. If I was lying about having traveled
around the world, for example, our confidence in the conclusion may be
undermined. </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Second, we need
to consider how strongly the premises support the
conclusion even if they're all true. There's no absolutely certain way
to figure this out, but we can make some rough judgments; for example,
the second version of the crow argument is much stronger than the first
because if premises 1-6 are all true we have more reason to believe the
conclusion than if just premises 1-3 are. </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">There is a
large literature on inductive arguments, and deservedly so:
most of the judgements we make in our ordinary lives can be
characterized as judgments based on induction. However, because the
conclusions of inductions are never completely certain, philosophers
very often avoid using inductive arguments and instead try to make
deductive arguments to persuade us of things. </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<h4 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">4. Deductive
arguments</h4>
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">While inductive
arguments merely try to show that something is probably
true, </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">deductive
arguments try to
prove their conclusions, that is, they try to show that the conclusion
is absolutely true.</span><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"> This is a much
higher standard of
persuasion, and difficult to meet. But it's something many philosophers
aspire to, and understandably so: no matter how strong an inductive
argument you make, you must always admit that there is some reason to
doubt whether its conclusion is true. But if you can make a strong
(that is, "sound") deductive argument, you can set aside your doubts.
The conclusion is true, period. </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Here is an
example of a deductive argument: </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<div
 style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Premise
1: All humans are mortal. <br>
Premise 2: Jeremy is a human. <br>
Conclusion: Jeremy is mortal.<br>
</div>
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">We can see that
the premises don't just make the conclusion probably
true; they make it true, period. Since the point of presenting an
argument is to persuade someone that something is true, deductive
arguments can be very handy. That's why many philosophers (and
non-philosophers) try to give deductive arguments to try to persuade
you of things. </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<h4 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">5. Evaluating
deductive arguments</h4>
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The problem is
that lots of arguments are faulty. Some arguments are so
obviously bad that you reject them at first sight. But other faulty
arguments may look quite appealing, and you may be fooled by them if
you're not careful. So it's good to have some tools with which to
evaluate arguments. To evaluate deductive arguments it's very handy to
understand two
concepts philosophers use: </span><b
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">validity</b><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"> and </span><b
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">soundness</b><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">. </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">First, let's
explain </span><b style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">validity</b><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">. Just as the word
"argument" has
a technical meaning in philosophy which is different from its meaning
in ordinary conversation, in philosophy we use the term "valid" in a
special way which you must learn and keep in mind. In ordinary
conversation, we tend to say that something is valid when we think it's
true, or right, or reasonable; it's a vague term of approval. But in
philosophy, "valid" means something very different, and very precise. </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Look again at
the
"Jeremy is mortal" argument.
Note that if we take away the particulars "graduate student," "mortal,"
and "Jeremy," we see that this argument has a certain </span><b
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">form</b><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">:
</span>
<blockquote style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Premise
1: All A are B. <br>
Premise 2: X is an A. <br>
Conclusion: X is B.</blockquote>
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">We can see that
no matter what we substitute for "A," "B," and "X," the
conclusion will still be logically supported by the premises. This
makes
the argument's form </span><b
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">valid</b><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">. Another way to
express it is this: </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">an
argument is valid if its form is such
that its conclusion must be true <span style="font-style: italic;">if </span>the
premises are true</span><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">. </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Note the word
"if" in the previous sentence. It means that a valid
argument does not necessarily have true premises or a true conclusion.
In philosophy, saying "That's a valid argument" doesn't tell you
anything about whether its premises or conclusion are true. It only
tells you that </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">if
</span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">the
premises were true, the conclusion would be true, too. So
keep in mind that </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">an
argument can be
valid
even if its premises and
conclusion
are false:</span>
<blockquote style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Premise
1: If the moon is made of green cheese, then the
sky
will fall this year. <br>
Premise 2: The moon is made of green cheese. <br>
Conclusion: The sky will fall this year.</blockquote>
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Even though the
premises and conclusion are all false (I hope), the
conclusion
is still logically supported by the premises, such that IF the premises
were true, the conclusion would also be true.
Thus, this argument is valid even though every part of it is false. </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Given the
definition of validity, we can easily figure out what </span><b
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">invalidity</b><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
is: it's when </span><b
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">even if the premises
are true, the conclusion might
not
be true</b><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">.
For example, look at this argument:
</span>
<blockquote style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Premise
1: Whenever I go to the ice cream parlor, I always
get vanilla ice cream. <br>
Premise 2: I got vanilla ice cream. <br>
Conclusion: I went to the ice cream parlor.</blockquote>
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Or, to strip it
down to its form:
</span>
<blockquote style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Premise
1: If P, then Q. <br>
Premise 2: Q. <br>
Conclusion: P.</blockquote>
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">It may appear
that, given the premises, the conclusion must be
true&#8212;until
you realize there are many different places for somebody to get vanilla
ice cream. I could have gotten it at the store, at a friend's house, or
made it at home. Notice that the same sort of problem will persist no
matter what we subsitute for "P" and "Q" here: even if the premises are
both true, the conclusion might not be. Arguments like this one are </span><b
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">invalid</b><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">.
</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">OK; so now you
have some idea of what an argument's form is, and you
know that validity has to do with an argument's form. And you've
noticed
that validity&#8212;good form&#8212;isn't enough, by itself, to make an argument
good.
To emphasize that point, let's consider the following example:
</span>
<blockquote style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Premise
1: Jeremy's brother-in-law has bright purple hair. <br>
Premise 2: President Bush is Jeremy's only brother-in-law. <br>
Conclusion: President Bush has bright purple hair.</blockquote>
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The form of
this argument is perfectly valid; we can see that </span><b
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">if</b><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
the premises were true the conclusion would also be true. But we know
that
President Bush does not have bright purple hair, so something must be
wrong:
one or more of the premises must be false. In this example, both
premises
happen to be false: I have no brother-in-law at all, let alone
President
Bush.
</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<b style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">If, on the other
hand, the premises are all true and the form is
valid, then the argument is sound</b><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">, as in the
following example:
</span>
<blockquote style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Premise
1: In every Wes Craven horror movie, at least one
character
gets killed off. <br>
Premise 2: Wes Craven has made at least five horror movies. <br>
Conclusion: At least five characters have been killed off in Wes
Craven's
horror movies.</blockquote>
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The argument's
form is valid and the premises are true, so the
conclusion
must be true.
</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">So what? Let me
explain. </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">When
confronted with a deductive argument (as you
will
be in philosophy classes), you should get in the habit of asking
yourself
two questions:
</span>
<blockquote
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">1.
Is the argument valid? <br>
2. Are the premises true?</blockquote>
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">If the answer
to both questions is "Yes," then the argument is </span><b
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">sound</b><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
and you have very strong reason to believe the conclusion is true. In
fact, if the argument really is sound it would be irrational for you to
deny the conclusion. But
if the
answer is "No" to either question, the argument is </span><b
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">unsound</b><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"> and
you
have reason to be skeptical about whether the conclusion is true.
</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Note that I
said "you have reason to be skeptical" (that is, you may
reserve judgment) about the conclusion--not that you should reject it
as
false. Why? Consider the following example:
</span>
<blockquote style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Premise
1: Circles are round. <br>
Premise 2: The moon is made of green cheese. <br>
Conclusion: The earth is round.</blockquote>
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">This argument's
form is invalid; its premises have no logical
connection
to the conclusion. And premise 2 is false: the moon isn't made of green
cheese; we all know it's made of feta cheese, which is why it's white.
Yet even so, the conclusion is true. So some caution is in order: even
if an argument is unsound (that is, even if its premises don't give you
good reason to believe its conclusion), the conclusion might still be
true.
</span><b style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Even
if the reasons given for a conclusion are bad, there may be good
reasons
for that conclusion lurking out there somewhere.</b><span
