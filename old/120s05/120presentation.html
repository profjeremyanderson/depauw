      <h4><font size="-1">Here's the basic idea:</font></h4>
      <blockquote><font size="-1">During the course I will guide you
through a bunch of
readings
which discuss some hot topics in ethics: abortion, euthanasia &amp;
assisted
suicide, capital punishment, and animals' rights. There are lots of
other
issues that may interest you, though, such as: </font>
        <blockquote><font size="-1">Is our nation's prohibition of
certain drugs
defensible? <br>
What do we owe, if anything, to people who are starving or
homeless?&nbsp; <br>
When is censorship justified?&nbsp; <br>
Should gay couples be allowed to marry? to bring up children?<br>
Should affirmative action be allowed? If so, when, and for whom?<br>
Was the US invasion of Iraq justified? Is the "War on Terror"
productive? <br>
Should cloning of animals be allowed? of people? or how about stem cell
research?<br>
          </font> </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote><font size="-1">You will need to pick one of these
issues or another
of
interest to you, find fellow students with similar interests, </font><font
 size="-1">form your own groups of of 2-4
people (though I might accept other sizes),</font><font size="-1"> get
me to
approve your topic, then research your topic and do a
presentation
on it in front of the class. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">The deadline for choosing a
topic and forming a group is Wednesday of
8th
Week (March 9th to be exact)</span>, which is when we will officially
assign
dates.
The sooner you clear your topic and group with me, the better the
choice
of dates you'll have. <a href="120home.html#late_policy">Once
a date
is set, it will be subject to the late policy stated in the course
syllabus</a>. </font>
        <p> </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1"><b>Sources</b><br>
      </font> </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">This is a research project, so I will expect
you to rely on an absolute minimum of two credible sources. Most good
presentations rely on four or more. <br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">For topics and source material I encourage
you to draw from
the
chapters of our textbook that I won&#8217;t be covering in lecture. They
contain
interesting and valuable arguments on these and other issues.&nbsp;<br>
        </font> </p>
        <p><font size="-1">At the end of each chapter in the book you
will also find
"Suggested
Additional Readings" on the topic of the chapter. Look there for more
material.<br>
        </font> </p>
        <p><font size="-1">The Armacost Library has access to the
online Philosopher's
Index, JSTOR, and other databases
which contains a vast trove of articles. Once you've settled on a topic
and gotten approval for it, try entering it in these databases to see
what pops up. <br>
        </font> </p>
        <p><font size="-1">You may also use the Internet, newspapers,
magazines, etc., <span style="font-weight: bold;">but you must be
careful</span> to find
good-quality
material. The Internet, for example, is much like a city dump: there
are
great things to be found there, but to reach them you have to sort
through
a lot of garbage. See me if you have any questions about what source
materials
to use. <br>
        </font> </p>
        <p><font size="-1">To search on the Internet start at my
Philosophy Research Links Page (<a href="../phil_links.html">click
here</a> or on the "Research Links" button on any of the course web
pages).</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <h4><font size="-1">Format</font></h4>
      <blockquote><font size="-1">Expect to take 20 minutes or so. Make
sure you include something that involves the class in your
presentation. Visual aids (writing on the board,
creating
posters, doing PowerPoint presentations, etc.) are encouraged. Handouts
which
summarize the main points or arguments are <b>strongly </b>encouraged;
if you get them to me by the night before your presentation I can copy
them for you. <br>
        <br>
You
might...<br>
        </font>
        <blockquote><font size="-1">Have each person present a
different perspective on
the
issue, or <br>
Stage a debate, or <br>
Lecture the way I do, or <br>
Make a film, or include clips from movies on your topic, or <br>
Do something completely different.<br>
          </font> </blockquote>
        <font size="-1">Each group will be expected to <br>
        </font>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="-1">present more
than one side of an issue</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">be fair to all sides&#8212;that is, to present
each side as strongly as
possible
whether you agree with it or not. Philosophy is, after all, a search
for
truth, not an attempt to merely win a point.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">create discussion questions or some other
way of involving the class</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">use (and cite) at least two sources,
though more would be better.</font></li>

      <h4><font size="-1"><a name="credit"></a> Credit</font></h4>
      <blockquote><font size="-1">Each participant in the group will be
graded
separately
for their work, and must submit written evidence of what they
contributed
and what sources they relied on. This evidence is due in class when the
presentation
is given. <b>This project is worth 20% of your grade for the course,
so I
will expect to see evidence of very substantial, new work by everyone
in
each
group.</b> Just downloading a web page and reading it to the class or
copying
it onto a PowerPoint slide, for example, is not acceptable. Presenting
work already submitted for credit in another course is also not
acceptable. <br>
        <br>
The work you do might consist of <br>
        </font>
        <blockquote><font size="-1">Research to find material to
present, <br>
Summarizing, re-writing, and/or organizing the material, <br>
Creating visual aids or handouts, and/or <br>
Doing the presenting itself. <br>
          </font> </blockquote>
        <font size="-1">Each group should visit with me well before the
presentation date to
discuss
plans and get some coaching. <br>
        <br>
        </font><font size="-1">I will create study questions based on
student presentations, and they
(like
all other study questions) will be fair game for exams. So an extra
benefit
of doing a presentation is that you will be the class expert on some of
the
study questions. </font><br>

      <font size="+3"><a name="essay"></a><font size="+2">Or else...</font></font>
      <p><font size="-1">The alternative to doing a small-group
presentation is to
write a
4-6 page essay on one of the two following topics:</font></p>
      <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>The Death Penalty. </b>Should it
be retained? If
so,
under what circumstances? Or should it be abolished entirely? For this
essay,
you must (a) <span style="font-weight: bold;">present </span>your
view, (b) <span style="font-weight: bold;">defend </span>it with the
strongest
arguments
you can (these arguments can come from any source), (c) <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">present</span>, in the
most
convincing and forceful way you can, the strongest argument(s) from the
course
readings that conflict(s) with your position, and (d) give me the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">strongest </span>reasons you can to take
your side in spite of the
opposing arguments in
part
(c).<br>
        <br>
        <b>The Value of Life. </b>Many of the arguments we&#8217;ve studied
either
implicitly or explictly endorse some criteria for determining whether a
life
has moral value: having certain abilities, having a certain sort of
future,
having rational capacity, and so on. Is one of these criteria (or sets
of
criteria) clearly superior to the others? Is there some other one not
discussed
in the class that is even better? For this essay, you must (a) <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">present </span>your
view on what gives life moral value, (b) give me the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">strongest </span>reasons
you
can to endorse your favored account of the value of life, by showing
how
it is superior to at least one competing account given in the course
readings,
and (c) show what ethical <span style="font-weight: bold;">conclusions
        </span>this account leads us to in one
of
the issues we&#8217;re studying in this course (abortion, euthanasia/PAS, the
death
penalty, or our treatment of animals). <br>
        </font> </blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">If neither of these topics interests you, you
may propose your
own
for my approval. But whatever topic you write on, you must take a side
on
an ethical issue and defend it against strong criticism, and I will
strongly
prefer that you consider at least some argument(s) from the assigned
reading
for the course.<br>
      </font> </p>
      <p><font size="-1">Whatever your topic, there will be some <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">firm </span>requirements: </font></p>
      <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Format. </b>Papers must be typed,
double-spaced,
with
1-inch margins all around (note that many word processors have a
default setting of 1.25"; you may need to adjust yours), in a
normal-sized font, and free of
typographical
and grammatical errors. I primarily evaluate content rather than length
or
style, so don&#8217;t worry if the length isn&#8217;t just right or if a couple of
misspellings
leak through. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Style. </span>Try to express
yourself in plain, everyday language,
using
your own words as much as possible and quoting as little as possible.
But regardless of whether you quote someone else's work or not, you
must still cite your sources. <br>
        <br>
        <b>References. </b>Be sure to cite your source <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">whenever you
use
or refer to an idea you got from someone else, whether you quote it or
not.</span>
If that means you have ten citations within a paragraph, so be it!
Failure to cite your sources will be dealt with <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">harshly:</span> penalties range from having
to rewrite the paper to failing the course; if it turns out to be a
repeat offense you could be expelled from the University. References to
articles
in <span style="font-style: italic;">Social Ethics</span> should be by
the article author&#8217;s name and page number
(e.g.,
Stewart et al., p. 121). References to outside sources must include
full
bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, date, etc., or
full
URL if the source is a web page).&nbsp; </font>
        <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>If you have the slightest doubt </b>about
proper procedures
for citing sources and avoiding plagiarism, ask me before you turn your
paper
in. You might also consult the <a href="../phil_links.html#sites">links
regarding plagiarism on my links page</a>.<br>
          </font> </blockquote>
        <font size="-1"><b>Papers are due in class on the final class
meeting,
Monday April 18.</b> <a href="120home.html#late_policy">See
the Syllabus for
the policy on late papers.</a> The essay will count for 20% of your
grade for the course. <br>
        </font> </blockquote>
      <font size="-1"><b>I strongly encourage you</b> to submit a draft
for feedback
at
least four days in advance of the due date. I also encourage you to
take advantage
of the free assistance with writing provided by Student Services in the
Writing
Lab on the ground level of the Armacost Library. Writing Lab hours are
posted
there, or you can call ext. 4079 for information. </font><br>
