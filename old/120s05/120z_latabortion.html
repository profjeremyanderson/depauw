<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"> WASHINGTON --
As the nation approaches the 30th
anniversary of Roe vs. Wade on Wednesday, the reasoning that the
Supreme
Court used to define a constitutional right to abortion is facing sharp
and
novel challenges.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">With the growth
of embryonic research, abortion opponents are finding
more
opportunities to upgrade the embryo's legal status. Lawmakers and
regulators are already considering whether the human embryo and fetus
deserve special legal protections in areas as diverse as patent
protection and homicide law.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Activists hope
that at the end of this road, abortion itself will fall.
Although they have spent the last three decades pursuing laws to
restrict or limit abortions, they now hope to strike at the core of the
1973 Supreme Court decision that said the unborn generally gain rights
only upon birth and women may choose abortion without restriction
during the first phases of pregnancy.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"In as many
areas as we can, we want to put on the books that the
embryo is a person," said Samuel B. Casey, executive director of the
Christian Legal Society, a public interest group in Virginia whose
clients include abortion opponents. "That sets the stage for a jurist
to acknowledge that human beings at any stage of development deserve
protection -- even protection that would trump a woman's interest in
terminating a pregnancy."</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Jeffrey Bell, a
Republican political strategist in Washington, said
debate
is refocusing on what matters most to antiabortion groups: the value of
human
life.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"Parental
notification rules don't really prohibit anything. They don't
ban the act of abortion," Bell said. "But a cloning ban -- this is
saying that something should be illegal. And if taking [unborn] human
life became illegal, that would be a breakthrough. Since Roe, no one
has been able to do that."</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">In debates
driven primarily by scientific and medical advances in
embryo development, policymakers are being forced to confront questions
about the embryo and fetus, drawing new energy and emotion to the
debate over their status.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Last week, New
Jersey Gov. James E. McGreevey announced that he would
sign
a bill endorsing the use of human embryos in stem cell research. In
Washington,
President Bush's bioethics panel debated the point at which a human
embryo
becomes an individual being. And in Nebraska, state Sen. Mike Foley
filed
a bill to allow wrongful death lawsuits involving the loss of an unborn
child,
an action he said was partly aimed at undermining the logic of Roe.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"We said
specifically in our bill that we did not want to challenge Roe
vs. Wade, and that it would not affect abortion in a legal sense,"
Foley said.
"But philosophically, sure, these laws are a challenge.... If a state
can
put someone in jail for life because they took the life of an unborn
child,
then we're clearly saying there's something very valuable there."</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">In the landmark
Roe vs. Wade decision, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said
for
the 7-2 majority that the court could not resolve "this most sensitive
and
difficult question" of when life begins.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"When those
trained in the respective disciplines of medicine,
philosophy and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the
judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not
in a position to speculate as to the answer," Blackmun wrote.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">At the same
time, Blackmun wrote, "the unborn have never been
recognized
in the law as persons in the whole sense."</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Finding no
legal status for the embryo, Blackmun concluded that a woman
has a privacy right to terminate a pregnancy in its early phases. A
later ruling said this period lasts until the fetus can live outside
the womb, or
about the 23rd week of development.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Once the fetus
is viable, the state may claim a "legitimate interest"
in
protecting the unborn child by regulating or even banning abortion,
Blackmun wrote.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Today, abortion
rights advocates say their opponents are trying to
undermine
Blackmun's argument by equating "the unborn" with "people" in various
areas
of the law.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">In Kentucky,
lawmakers this month filed a bill to permit homicide
charges when an unborn child is killed, though abortion doctors and
other health-care providers would be exempted. The proposal, which is
already in law in at least
27 states, defines "an unborn child" as a person.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Last year, the
Bush administration allowed states to define embryos and
fetuses as children eligible for medical coverage under Medicaid. And
the
administration defined embryos as "human subjects" when it directed a
panel
to study protections for people who participate in medical research.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Administration
officials said those actions were unrelated to abortion,
but abortion rights advocates said the intent was to upend Roe.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"If you can get
enough of these bricks in place, draw enough examples
from
different parts of life and law where embryos are treated as babies,
then
how can the Supreme Court say they're not?" said R. Alta Charo, a
professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin. "This is
without question a conscious strategy." Much of the new thinking about
embryos is a result of medical research.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">When Blackmun
wrote the Roe decision, developing life was always viewed
in tandem with the mother's body. Then in 1978 came the first birth
through in vitro fertilization -- the technique of merging egg and
sperm in a laboratory dish to produce a human embryo.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"Now, for the
first time, you had the opportunity to ask what is the
moral
and legal status of the embryo sitting in a lab dish, separate and
independent
from the woman's right to control her own destiny," Charo said. "You
saw
the embryo as a distinct thing."</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">With embryos
separate from the woman's body, and often frozen for
future use, courts were soon drawn into divorce disputes that asked
whether embryos were more like property, subject to contract law, or
like people, with their own rights and interests. The law is still
unsettled.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">More recently,
scientists have raised the prospect that embryo stem
cells
could yield clues to curing disease. Now, the status of embryos is
being
weighed against the hopes of patients and the desire of scientists to
pursue
promising and possibly profitable research.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">How should the
law view "excess" embryos that are made by one couple,
then
given to a second set of hopeful parents? The Christian Legal Society
is
pushing for these embryos to be "adopted" under state law as children,
rather
than transferred like property. Separately, Congress is debating
whether to
ban the creation of embryos through cloning.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"All this gives
you different sets of values to weigh against the
embryo, other than a woman's ability to control her pregnancy," Charo
said. "It's like those old balancing scales, where you never knew the
weight of anything. You only knew whether it weighed more or less than
what was on the other side
of the scale."</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The result has
been that embryos are treated differently depending on
their
location, a condition far from the uniformly elevated status that
abortion
opponents want to assign to embryos. Under federal law, for example, a
scientist
with private funds may create and destroy embryos, or even mix in
animal
genes. Yet the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office gives embryos a special
status,
saying they are among the few things that cannot be patented.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Still,
developments in embryo research have brought new energy to the
antiabortion
movement, said William Kristol, an anticloning activist and editor of
the
Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"You've had
these two armies in the abortion fight dug into their
trenches, with very little movement," he said. "Now, suddenly there are
a lot of skirmishes that might transform the broader battle."</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">For Kate
Michelman, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, an abortion
rights
group, nothing in the new debate overtakes Blackmun's basic observation
that
there is wide disagreement about when life begins.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">And she says
that although much of the debate involves embryos outside
the
woman's body and embryos used to create wanted children, abortion is
still
about unwanted pregnancies.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"The fact that
we're learning more about the embryo and fetal
development doesn't change the fundamental question of who gets to make
decisions about a woman's body," she said.</span></div>
