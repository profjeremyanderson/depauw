Under what circumstances, if any, does John Paul II think abortion is
permissible? <br>
        <br>
8. Why is it important for John Paul II to establish that the life of a
fetus &#8220;is neither that of the father nor the mother; it is rather the
life of a new human being&#8221; (p. 12)? <br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">9. Why is it
important for John Paul II to establish that the human
fetus is innocent?</span><br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">10. Give John Paul
II&#8217;s argument regarding the permissibility of
abortion. (You may use what was written on the board or put it in your
own
words, but be sure to make his line of reasoning as clear as you can
and identify any unstated premises he relies on.)</span><br>
        <br>
11. Under what circumstances, if any, does Warren think abortion is
permissible? <br>
        <br>
12. Does Warren think fetuses are persons or not? Explain how she
arrives at this opinion, being careful to include her reasons for
believing that personhood is not established by being genetically
human. <br>
        <br>
13. How does Warren respond to the claim that the fetus deserves
protection because it is a potential person? <br>
        <br>
14. According to Warren, what is wrong with infanticide (killing
babies)? <br>
        <br>
15. Make an objection against some part of Warren&#8217;s argument. That is,
identify a conclusion she reaches which you think may be mistaken, and
give the strongest reasons you can for me to agree with you that she is
mistaken. (You may use one of the objections raised in class if you
like.) <br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">16. Explain how
Marquis figures out what's wrong with killing you or
me. Then explain how he thinks this applies to abortion.</span><br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">17. Why does
Marquis need to show that contraception is not morally
wrong? How does he do so?</span><br>
        <br>
18. Explain at least one problem with Marquis' argument against
abortion. (You may rely on lecture if you like.)<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">19. Despite their
obviously different conclusions about abortion, what
important assumption is shared by Pope John Paul II and Warren? What
does Thomson think of this assumption?</span><br>
        <br>
20. Some anti-abortionists argue that even if a woman's life is
threatened by her pregnancy, a third party (like a doctor) may not
intervene to help her abort it. According to Thomson, what reason might
anti-abortionists give for this? <br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">21. How does
Thomson argue that third parties (like doctors) may
intervene to help a woman abort a life-threatening pregnancy?</span><br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">22. Thomson
considers two different versions of "what it comes to, to
have a right to life" (p. 55f). What are they, and what reasons does
she give for rejecting each of them?</span><br>
        <br>
        <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">23. Under what
circumstances does Thomson think abortion is permissible--that is, when
would abortion not be an injustice to the fetus? When would abortion be
unjust? (I'm not asking when she thinks abortion is decent or indecent.)<br>
        <br>
24. How does Thomson argue that the use of birth control amounts to
denying permission for the fetus to use a woman's body? <br>
        <br>
25. Identify at least one problem with Thomson's "burglar" and/or
"people seeds" analogies (pp. 58-9). <br>
        <br>
26. How does Thomson argue that it is unfair to require pregnant women
to be "good Samaritans" to their fetuses?<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">27. The state of
Texas claimed that abortions should be prohibited
(except to save the mother's life) because abortion is dangerous to
women. How does Blackmun respond to Texas on this point? What
conclusion did he draw from this about when and why states may restrict
abortion?</span><br>

does Blackmun respond to Texas on this point? What conclusion did he
draw from this about when and why states may restrict abortion?<br>
        <br>
29. In the case of Planned Parenthood of PA v. Casey, what restrictions
did the state of Pennsylvania place on access to abortion? What did
O'Connor et al. rule regarding these restrictions?<br>

      <h4><font size="-1">Unit III: Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted
Suicide<br>
      </font></h4>
      <blockquote><font size="-1"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">30.
How was "euthanasia" defined in class? Explain how euthanasia differs
from murder and from eugenics.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">31. Define the
following as they were presented in the course:
"killing," "letting die," "active euthanasia," "passive euthanasia."</span>
        <br>
        <br>
32. Define the following terms: voluntary euthanasia, non-voluntary
euthanasia, involuntary euthanasia. Why are we not debating the
morality of involuntary euthanasia in this course?<br>
        <br>
33. In lecture, three reasons for forbidding voluntary
active euthanasia were presented and rejected. Explain each of them,
and why each was rejected.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">34. In lecture,
two better reasons for forbidding voluntary active
euthanasia were presented and taken seriously. Explain each of them.</span><br>
        <br>
35. In lecture, the two usual reasons in favor of allowing voluntary
active euthanasia were presented. Explain each of them, including why
each may be weak on its own.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">36. What is now
the "Standard View" on euthanasia in law and among most
doctors?</span><br>
        <br>
37. Explain Rachels' argument that, because VAE can be more humane than
VPE, the Standard View is mistaken. (You need not present it word for
word, but explain his reasoning.)<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">38. Explain
Rachels' argument that killing is not intrinsically worse
than letting die. If he's right, why should we conclude that VAE should
be permissible? (In other words, explain how Rachels thinks the
parallel cases establish that VAE should be permitted.) Finally,
explain at least one problem with Rachels' parallel cases.</span> <br>
        <br>
39. Many doctors claim that VAE is wrong because it causes death, but
VPE is okay because it is the patient's condition that kills, not the
doctor. Explain Rachels' argument against this. <br>
        <br>
40. Why does Brock think self-determination is important? What view on
VAE does this lead him to support? <br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">41. Why does Brock
think that VAE supports patient well-being? How does
his view differ from Rachels' in this regard?</span> <br>
        <br>
42. Gaylin says that legalizing VAE would undermine trust our trust of
doctors (p. 78). What is Brock's response? Why might Brock's response
be inadequate?<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">43. Of the various
considerations &amp; arguments offered so far in
favor of allowing VAE (from Rachels and Brock), which do you find most
persuasive? Which do you find least persuasive? Give me the strongest
reasons you can to agree with your assessments.</span>&nbsp; <br>
        </span></font><font size="-1"><br>
44. Explain Callahan's "moral" argument about the distinction between
killing and letting die.<br>
        <br>
45. In his "medical" argument, Callahan argued that active euthanasia
should not be allowed because it is incompatible with doctors'
traditional role. What does Callahan think a doctor's proper role is?
When we discussed this in class, what came up for and against Callahan
on this point?<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">46. What impact
does Potts think that legalized euthanasia could have
one the search for new cures and better medical treatments (his #1) ?
How come?</span><br>
        <br>
47. What abuses does Potts fear if voluntary active euthanasia is
legalized (his #4, 5, &amp; 9)? <br>
        <br>
48. What form do slippery slope arguments have? (In other words, what
two propositions must they persuade us of in order to be sound?)<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">49. In what two
ways does Potts argue that legalizing voluntary active
euthanasia could lead us down a slippery slope (his #7 and 8)? What
problems with his arguments were discussed in class? (Hint: One good
way to do this would be to explain how Potts' arguments try to fulfill
the requirments for a slippery slope argument, and what problems they
have doing so.)</span><br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">50. Explain the
"Dilemma of Regulation" with regard to voluntary active
euthanasia.</span><br>
        <br>
51. What three kinds of rights were discussed in class? Define and give
an example of each.<br>
        </font><font size="-1"><br>
52. Watts &amp; Howell identify three different types of assisted
suicide (p. 85). What are they? Which ones do Watts &amp; Howell think
should be allowed?<br>
        <br>
53. Why do Watts &amp; Howell believe that legalizing (some forms of)
physician-assisted suicide would not undermine doctor-patient trust
(pp. 87-8)?<br>
        <br>
54. Rehnquist believes that legalizing physician-assisted suicide could
endanger members of certain "vulnerable groups" (p. 96). How come? And
what reasons lead Watts &amp; Howell to disagree (pp. 86-7)?<br>

How have the methods for executing people and the circumstances of
execution changed over the years? <br>
      <br>
56. Define the following terms: retentionist, abolitionist.<br>
      <br>
57. In lecture, two common but faulty arguments regarding the death
penalty were discussed. Explain each one, and the problems each suffers
from. <br>
      <br>
58. Define the following terms as they were presented in class:
retribution, equal punishment, equal harm.<br>
      <br>
59. In lecture we discussed four goods that utilitarians have thought
punishment should seek. Explain what they are, and explain why some are
compatible with the death penalty while others are not.<br>
      <br>
60. In their 1972 ruling in Furman v. Georgia, why did the Supreme
Court strike down Georgia's death penalty law? <br>

the death penalty accords with human dignity, i.e., that it is not
excessive. What are their reasons for this?<br>

in a constitutionally acceptable way?<br>

02-04. Kant argues that utilitarianism should be rejected as a
rationale for punishment because it could sanction injustice. Explain
one of the examples used in class to show this. <br>
      <br>
02-05. Kant uses several examples to show that his "equal punishment"
interpretation of the Lex Talionis is clear and easy to apply. Explain
one of them (one that does NOT involve the death penalty). Why is it
easier to apply "equal punishment" than it would be to apply
Utilitarianism?<br>
      <br>

nothing less than the death penalty will do. Explain why. (If it helps
you to draw diagrams, that's fine; but be sure to explain what they

      <br>
02-08. Does Kant consistently stick to his principle of "equal
punishment"? Explain how. Does American society follow "equal
punishment"? Explain how. What implications does this have for
retentionism? <br>
      <br>
02-09. How does Nathanson argue that Primoratz's "equal harm" principle
fails to guide us? <br>
      <br>
02-10. How would we have to modify our methods of punishment if we want
to follow Primoratz's "equal harm" principle? If we are unwilling to do
so, what implications does this have for retentionism? How come? <br>
      <br>
02-11. What is Nathanson's "proportionate retribution" proposal? Why
does he think we should not include the death penalty on our list of
punishments?<br>
      <br>
02-12. Many people think that the death penalty is clearly a better
incapacitator than life in prison, and that it is also a better
deterrent. Why are these beliefs both mistaken?<br>
      <br>
02-13. What is Pojman's "common-sense" argument for the death penalty? <br>
      <br>
02-14. What anecdotal evidence does Pojman offer to support his
common-sense argument? (Note that I am asking about the anecdotes, not
about the argument.) Why do these anecdotes fail to help support the
argument very strongly? <br>
      <br>
02-15. The "common-sense" argument for the death penalty assumes that
scarier punishments
have more deterrent value. How does Reiman show that this is not
necessarily the case?<br>
      <br>
02-16. If you are sentenced to death in the US, how long (on average)
will it be before you are executed? Explain what effect this has on the
deterrent value of the death penalty.<br>
      <br>
02-17. If you commit murder in California, approximately how likely are
you to be executed for it? How about in Texas? Explain what effect this
has on the deterrent value of the death penalty.<br>
      <br>
02-18. How does van den Haag (via Pojman) argue that retaining the
death penalty is our "best bet"? <br>
      <br>
02-19. From the presentation on affirmative action: Charles Murray
believes that preferential treatment places minorities in a situation
where they are considered inferior, and thus fosters a new form of
racism. How does he argue for this?<br>
      <br>
02-20. From the presentation on affirmative action: Hettinger admits
that his affirmative action proposal judges people on the basis of
involuntary characteristics. How does he argue that this objection
isn't strong enough to reject his proposal?<br>
      <br>
02-21. From the presentation on world hunger: Hardin believes that, if
a country fails to control its population, giving it food aid will
actually make things much worse in the long run because of the "ratchet
effect." Explain this effect and why Hardin thinks it will lead to
greater disaster.<br>
      <br>
02-22. From the presentation on world hunger: Sen points out that
famine can occur when there is plenty of food. What does this tell us
about Malthus's theory of the cause of poverty?<br>
      <br>
02-23. From the presentation on genocide in Darfur: Fiona presented
three main reasons for the US to intervene in Darfur. Explain at least
two of them.<br>
      <br>
02-24. From the presentation on genocide in Darfur: Molly defended a
Social Darwinist approach to Darfur. What does Social Darwinism
recommend we do about Darfur? How is this different from eugenics? <br>
      <br>
      <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">02-25. Van den Haag
(via Pojman) argues that retaining the death
penalty is our "best bet" for saving innocent lives. How did Jeremy
argue that in fact the opposite is true?</span> <br>
      <br>
02-26. From the <a href="120readings.html#presentations">presentation
on animal rights</a>: Singer denies that our higher intellect entitles
us to eat animals and experiment on them. According to him, what do
animals have that obliges us to stop causing animal suffering? <br>
      <br>
02-27. From the presentation on animal rights: According to Cohen
(whose argument was presented by Matthew), why can't animals have
rights? <br>
      <br>
02-28. From the <a href="120readings.html#presentations">presentation
on same-sex marriage</a>: What sorts of problems does Kmiec believe
children may have if raised by gay parents?<br>
      <br>
02-29. From the presentation on same-sex marriage: Identify at least
two differences between marriage and civil unions. <br>

in a constitutionally acceptable way?<br>
      <br>
03-06. Kant argues that utilitarianism should be rejected as a
rationale for punishment because it could sanction injustice. Explain
one of the examples used in class to show this. <br>
      <br>
03-07. Kant uses several examples to show that his "equal punishment"
interpretation of the Lex Talionis is clear and easy to apply. Explain
one of them (one that does NOT involve the death penalty). Why is it
easier to apply "equal punishment" than it would be to apply
Utilitarianism?<br>

03-16. From the <a href="120readings.html#presentations">presentation
on drug control &amp; addiction</a>: Some have
said that cocaine and heroin should be legalized because they are less
destructive than alcohol, which is legal. How does Wilson respond to

allowing same-sex couples to adopt because they believe children will
be harmed by it. What did a recent study claim to show about this? (<a
 href="http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;109/2/341">If
you want to see the study, go here</a>.)<br>
      <br>
03-21. From the presentation on starvation and homelessness:
Neo-Malthusians favor the "method of triage" for deciding when to give
aid. Explain this method, and why they think some needy countries
should receive no aid. <br>
      <br>
03-22. From the presentation on starvation and homelessness: Hardin
describes three options we have for deciding whether to admit needy
people into our "lifeboat." What are they? What does he think is wrong
