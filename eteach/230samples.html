              <li>For exams given in class, you must write your answers
                from memory during the exam. No citing or quoting is
                required. You many not access books or notes of any
                kind, or collaborate with others, during an in-class
                exam.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>You may use any of these sample answers if you like.
                  Again, no citing or quoting needed. <br>
                  <br>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>For take-home exams (which we will have if an exam
                must be given remotely):</li>
              <ul>
                <li>You may use any class materials (assigned texts;
                  notes &amp; other materials posted on Moodle such as
                  these sample answers, or the linked Google Drive
                  folders) and your own notes from class.</li>
                <li>No other sources allowed. No collaboration with
                  other people on the exam.</li>
                <li>The <a href="230papers.html#integrity">academic

                <ul>
                  <li>So, for an in-class exam, if you use any of these

                        about the basis of moral rules--that is, about
                        how moral rules get their validity, if any.<br>
                        <br>
                        Moral skepticism admits that there are moral
                        rules, but it says they have no basis, or none
                        we can know for sure. So, skeptics think there
                        are no real moral obligations. Moral skepticism
                        suggests that ethics are a kind of fraud.<br>
                        <br>
                        Unlike moral skepticism, moral subjectivism says
                        that moral rules can be justified, and they are
                        justified by your opinion. In other words,
                        subjectivism holds that an act is right only if
                        you think it is; otherwise it is not.<br>
                        <br>
                        Cultural relativism also says that moral rules
                        can be justified. Unlike subjectivism, cultural
                        relativism says the basis of moral rules is
                        culture: an act is right only if your culture
                        approves of it; otherwise not.<br>
                        <br>
                        Ethical objectivism says that at least some (but
                        not necessarily all) moral rules have a basis
                        independent of personal opinion or culture, such
                        that they apply to everyone regardless of what
                        their individual judgment or society says.</td>

              </div>
              <br>
              This shows a clear understanding that these are views
              about whether and how moral principles can be justified,
              and clearly states each view's take on the matter.<br>
              <br>
              Again, for an in-class exam no citation or quoting is
              necessary. But if an exam is take-home you must follow the
              <a href="230quests.html#integrity_on_exams">academic
                integrity requirements for exams</a>. So, for this
              answer, you would add citations to the text and class
              notes if you used them (which you should), and if you
              borrowed any wording from this answer you must put it in
              quotation marks and cite this page: (Phil 230: Sample
              Answers). <br>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Some questions are harder.
              Questions with highlighted numbers (like this: <span
                style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">6. </span>)
              will be worth more points on exams because they call for
              more extensive, thoughtful answers. They might also
              require you to give and support your own opinion.<br>
              <br>
              Here's an example: imagine a situation where a
              conservative Saudi Muslim, Adara, condemns Beth's immodest
              clothing and Beth -- a liberal American atheist --
              condemns Adara's attempt to control her behavior. I might
              ask, <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Explain how
                Aquinas might resolve the dispute between Adara and
                Beth. In other words, given what Aquinas says in the
                assigned reading, is there any prospect of resolving
                their dispute? What might it be? What&#8217;s most important
                here is to say how Aquinas would approach this matter."</span><br
                style="font-weight: bold;">
              <br>
              Here you are asked to take ideas from Aquinas and apply
              them to a possible situation. This is a dispute where
              Adara and Beth dislike each other's behavior and this
              dislike is connected with moral rules of their respective
              cultures.<br>

                        Christianity and obey its rules. Beth could then
                        show her face in public and Adara would respect
                        this behavior, and both of them would avoid
                        going to Hell.</td>

              <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>This answer is
              not factually wrong, so I wouldn't give it a zero. But you
              could give this answer based merely on knowing Aquinas was
              Christian, without ever doing the reading or paying
              attention in class. So this is a bad answer.<br>

                        rgb(255, 255, 255);">Based on the reading we
                        have, it&#8217;s hard to tell exactly how Aquinas
                        might resolve Adara &amp; Beth&#8217;s dispute.
                        Aquinas gives us a universal moral standard of
                        natural law that might be used to settle
                        disputes between people from different cultures.
                        But it&#8217;s not clear that this standard (at least
                        what we have of it) tells us what to do to
                        settle this case.<br>
                        <br>
                        On one hand, Aquinas definitely thinks there are
                        some universal moral truths. There are some
                        precepts we can figure out by observing human
                        nature (Aquinas, <span style="font-style:
                          italic;">Summa</span>, 4-5), and anyone&#8217;s
                        behavior may be judged by those precepts.
                        Moreover, any particular rule in a given society
                        may be evaluated by reference to those precepts.
                        Because of this, it seems that for Aquinas there
                        may be some way of resolving this dispute --
                        that is, some way we can get beyond the
                        unproductive head-butting of subjectivism (which
                        leaves us with &#8220;Adara said vs. Beth said&#8221;) or
                        cultural relativism (which leaves us with &#8220;Saudi
                        culture says vs. American culture says&#8221;). <br>
                        <br>
                        More specifically, Aquinas says that we all seek
                        the good and that we are naturally inclined
                        towards some particular goods, including social
                        living (<span style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>,
                        5; cf. Aquinas, <span style="font-style:
                          italic;">De Regno</span>, 1). He says that
                        "whatever pertains to this inclination belongs
                        to the natural law; for instance...to avoid
                        offending those among whom one has to live" (<span
                          style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>, 5).
                        This means that natural law tells us to do what
                        will help us live socially, and that includes
                        avoiding offending people. Also, he emphatically
                        says that law always tells us to seek the common
                        good, not just our own private good, because as
                        members of society we are like parts of a whole
                        (<span style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>,
                        2). Adara and Beth are offending each other, so
                        we could at least conclude that their dispute
                        should not continue, especially if it could lead
                        to any disruption of society.<br>
                        <br>
                        On the other hand, Aquinas allows that <span
                          style="font-style: italic;">human</span>-made
                        moral rules (not the precepts of natural law --
                        they always apply to everyone) may not apply in
                        all particular cases. For example, he says it is
                        generally right to give back what you have
                        borrowed, but not if it were, say, weapons that
                        would be used "to fight against one's country" (<span
                          style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>, 5).
                        Aquinas says the precepts -- which he sometimes
                        calls "general principles" (Summa, 5) -- apply
                        to everyone. But to apply the precepts we derive
                        "secondary principles" (<span style="font-style:
                          italic;">Summa</span>, 6) -- the particular
                        rules of our society -- which might not always
                        apply. He identifies two ways in which a given
                        rule may fail to apply universally. First, it
                        may apply in some societies but not others. A
                        modern example of this is the rule of driving on
                        the right side of the road. Second, like the
                        rule about giving back what is "held in trust" (<span
                          style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>, 5),
                        there may be circumstances where justice
                        requires an exception to a rule that is
                        generally legitimate.<br>
                        <br>
                        So Aquinas gives us a general approach to
                        discovering the universal moral law: identifying
                        first principles, then deriving secondary
                        principles from them which we can then apply to
                        particular situations.<br>
                        <br>
                        But given what is said in the readings and the
                        prompt, it is not clear how this might resolve
                        Adara and Beth's disagreement. Is Adara's rule
                        about women's public attire more clearly
                        justified by the precepts than Beth's, or vice
                        versa? Can we deduce from the precepts some rule
                        about how to adjudicate their dispute? The
                        answers to these questions are not obvious.
                        Perhaps it would be helpful if we knew more. For
                        example, if the dispute were taking place in
                        Saudi Arabia -- which takes rules about women's
                        attire much more seriously than the United
                        States -- Aquinas might say that the potential
                        for social disruption and giving offense to
                        others is lower if Beth wears a veil, and that
                        therefore she ought to do so.</td>

              Wow, right? That's impressive. This would get an 'A.'<br>
              <br>
              This answer does not say "Aquinas would say that Adara
              and/or Beth should do X." But that's fine, because the
              answer gives reasons, grounded in the Aquinas reading, for
              why it's hard to come to such a neat conclusion. That's
              what to do here: show how Aquinas thinks about a
              situation.<br>
              <br>
              However, if your answer shows a way that Aquinas could
              resolve their dispute which is consistent with his general
              principles, that'd be great, too.<br>
              <br>
              Of course I wouldn't expect you to give this exact answer!
              Nor would I expect you to quote Aquinas or give page
              numbers on an in-class exam. I put them here to help you
              find the material in the text if you want.<br>
              <br>
              If the exam is take-home, though, you must follow the <a

              So, for this answer, you would add citations to the text
              and to class notes if you used them, and if you borrowed
              any wording from this answer you must put it in quotation
              marks and cite this page: (Phil 230: Sample Answers). <br>
