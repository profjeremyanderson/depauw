                this course are to acquaint you with philosophy&#8217;s
                content and techniques, and sharpen your writing and
                thinking. Through reading, lecture, discussion,
                and&nbsp; writing you&#8217;ll get to know some of
                philosophy&#8217;s major divisions, including epistemology,
                metaphysics, and ethics, and some of the puzzles that
                philosophers concern themselves with. Is the outside
                world as it appears to be? Does God exist? Are we free?
                How should we lead our lives? You will learn about and
                evaluate major thinkers' answers to such questions. You
                will also enhance your critical thinking skills so that
                your beliefs can be better grounded in logic, deepened
                by an understanding of the issues at stake, and tempered
                with an appreciation of opposing views. <br>

              <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading
                assignments for this course typically consist of a
                selection written by a philosopher and some introductory
                material written by the book&#8217;s editor, Andrew Bailey.
                Bailey suggests you read the selection first, and then
                go back and read the introductory material, and then
                read the selection again (Preface, p. vii). <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">I recommend following this
                  advice.</span> (The few exceptions are noted on the
                Reading Assignments page.)</font><br>
              <br>
              <font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Come to
                  class, on time, prepared. </span>Bring the current
                reading and your notes with you. Bring your responses to
                the current reading questions with you. If you don&#8217;t
                come, make arrangements with others to share notes with
                you. I suggest agreeing with at least two other people
                in the class, at the beginning of the semester, to share
                notes.</font><br>
              <br>
              <font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Take
                  detailed notes. </span>Just copying what&#8217;s on the
                board is not sufficient. If the notes you take during
                class are sketchy, take a moment after class to fill
                them out. </font><br>

                aren't worth asking or their comments not worth making,
                but often others wanted to say the same thing. Don&#8217;t
                allow yourself to stay confused or lost. If you are not
                comfortable speaking in class, see me outside it. </font><br>

              <font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keep up
                  with the study guide every week. </span>When new
                items are added to the study guide, sit down with your
                books and notes and classmates (if you like--studying in
                groups is helpful) and write out the clearest, most
                complete and thoughtful answers you can. If you have
                trouble formulating answers, come see me for help. Study
                your answers regularly to prepare for class discussion
                and for exams. This will pay off.</font><br>
