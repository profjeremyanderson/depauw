                  stimulate discussion with your classmates, so I
                  recommend doing something besides, or perhaps instead
                  of, summarizing, such as... <br>
                </font></li>
              <li><font size="-1">Explain why you think the material is

              <li><font size="-1">Present some puzzle about the text:
                  some central issue that is unresolved, or resolved in
                  a way we might disagree with. <br>

                  well, and/or point out some important error(s) made.
                  (For some reason, pointing to errors often works
                  better. You might contrast an author's view with a
                  differing view you think is very plausible, or point
                  out some fallacy in the text, or point to some
                  unattractive consequence(s) of the author's view.)<br>

                  provocative.)<br>

                  discuss, raising them all at once might not be best.
                  Instead, you could raise one, have us talk about it,
                  raise another, and so on. <br>

            </ul>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">Since your
                job is to provoke discussion--not teach the text--try to
                do your spiel in a way that provokes, invites, or at
                least does not quash discussion. Some pointers for this
                are:<br>

                  only possibly justified one. Your task here is not to
                  convert the class to the One True Reading Of The Text.
                  (You may try to do that during the ensuing
                  discussion.) <br>

              <li><font size="-1">Raise open-ended questions, as opposed
                  to yes/no questions. Ask questions you think you know
                  the answer to, but also ask questions you are clueless

                thinking about your research paper long before it is
                due. Second, to give you early feedback about your
                topic.&nbsp; Third, for you to practice explaining
                philosophical ideas to a non-philosophical
                audience.&nbsp; In line with the third goal, when
                preparing your presentation you should have in mind an
                audience of people who are intelligent, intellectually
                curious, but unfamiliar with philosophy and somewhat
                skeptical about its worth.&nbsp; </font><br>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">Here&#8217;s one
                way you might think of it: Suppose you were hanging out
                with the parents of your significant other and had about
                fifteen minutes to kill, and one of them casually asked
                you, &#8220;So, what are you writing your big philosophy paper
                on?&#8221;&nbsp; (For this to work, assume that the parents in
                question are not complete idiots/jerks.&nbsp; If
                necessary, please adjust your thought experiment
                accordingly).</font><br>

              <font size="-1">You will be on the spot for 15-20 minutes.
                <br>
                <br>
                Roughly the first five minutes of your time should
                consist of you explaining the topic of your paper in
                general terms and providing some specifics about at
                least one of the main issues, questions, puzzles,
                arguments, etc. that you plan to discuss in your
                paper.&nbsp; At this early stage you do not need to have
                the entire paper planned out or know what your ultimate
                conclusion will be, but you should have a good grip on
                at least one of the central issues you will take up in
                the paper.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Your
                  mission is to lay out one of these issues in a
                  compelling way. Show us why this issue is worth
                  thinking about.</span>&nbsp; As when instigating
                discussion of a reading, you may use notes or an
                outline, but do not simply read to the class.&nbsp; You
                are free to use props (e.g. handouts, PowerPoint) this
                time around if you like, but props are not at all
                necessary.&nbsp; Please use them <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">only </span>if they will
                help you better get your ideas across.&nbsp; </font><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">After your
                initial 5-minute presentation, you will field questions
                from your fellow students and professor for about 10-15
                minutes.&nbsp; The best way to prepare for this brief
                question-and-answer period is to have a clear grasp of
                your topic and its importance.</font><br>

              <font size="-1">These presentation/discussions must be
                limited to about 20 minutes and occur one right after
                the other.&nbsp; So, use your time well. You should plan
                and rehearse what you want to say. </font><br>
              <br>
              <font size="-1">Any set-up time counts as part of your
                allotted time.&nbsp; This is something to keep in mind
                when making decisions about using props; if you have to
                spend five minutes fussing with something before you
                begin, this will have a negative impact on your
                grade.&nbsp; You must rule technology, don&#8217;t let
                technology rule you.</font><br>

                </span>We will follow the typical format of a
                professional philosophy conference: a speaker will
                present their paper for 15 minutes; a classmate&nbsp;
                will comment on the paper for five minutes; then we will
                open the floor to questions from the audience for ten
                minutes. The goals here include practice presenting and
                discussing complex philosophical issues orally, and
                getting feedback from classmates on a complete draft of
                your final paper before it is due so that your final
                paper will be even better than it would otherwise have
                been.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

                  responsibilities of paper presenters</span><br>
                <br>
              </font><font size="-1">As speaker, your central mission is
                to explain the thesis and central argument(s) of your
                paper to the audience in a clear, well-organized,
                easy-to-follow fashion. You may use whatever props you
                think are helpful in this endeavor; a good handout can
                go a long way, particularly if you will refer repeatedly
                to quotations, principles, or arguments. You may use
                notes. <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:
                  italic;">However, you shall not under any
                  circumstances simply read from your paper or anything
                  else. </span>Your presentation should be roughly
                fifteen minutes. <br>
                <br>
                This is challenging. Doing well requires substantial
                preparation (beyond simply writing a good paper). You
                should practice in advance. You may also want to visit
                the &#8220;S&#8221; center. Presenting complex philosophical ideas
                orally is quite different from presenting them in
                writing; sentences that make sense written on a page can
                be hard to grasp when spoken aloud. So the way you
                present your ideas in the talk may differ from the way
                you do in the paper.</font><br>

                  do so will result in your final paper grade being
                  reduced. If it is late by even one day it will be

              </font><font size="-1">Each of you will present your
                paper, and each of you will give prepared comments on a
                classmate's paper. When you serve as commenter, your
                mission is to provide a brief (five minute) commentary
                on the speaker&#8217;s paper that stimulates both the speaker
                and the audience to think more deeply about the
                speaker&#8217;s ideas. One good way to do this is to provide
                constructive criticism of the speaker&#8217;s arguments. </font><br>
              <br>
              <font size="-1">Just as the speaker should provide you
                with a draft of his or her paper in a timely fashion,
                you should read and think about that paper in a timely
                fashion. Depending on the nature of the paper in
                question, you may want to do additional reading in
                preparing your comments. Reading the paper the morning
                of the presentation and spewing out a few half-assed
                questions is neither appropriate nor a way to pass this
                assignment. Instead, you'll provide the speaker with
                your comments the evening prior to the talk. The goal
                here is not to spring a devastating objection upon your
                hapless speaker but rather to stimulate them to write a
                better paper.</font><br>
              <br>
              <font size="-1">It is likely you will have comments on
                "big" issues, such as whether the paper's main points
                are clear and whether its arguments are sound, but also
                "small" issues such as matters of style. When you
                present your comments in front of the class, focus most
                on the big things, either leaving the small ones for
                last if there is time, or e-mailing them to the paper's
                author. </font><br>

              </font><font size="-1">Questioning and criticizing the
                views and arguments of your classmates and professor is
                appropriate and encouraged, but do it in a courteous and
                respectful way. Courtesy and respect range from the way
                speaker and commenter interact prior to the presentation
                (e.g., providing the speaker with your main criticisms
                in advance rather than springing them on him or her with
                no warning) to the way in which the criticisms are
                presented (e.g., &#8220;One possible problem with Anderson's
                argument is that P&#8221; rather than &#8220;Anderson has obviously
                overlooked P, which decisively refutes his position;
                it&#8217;s hard to believe that anyone could make such an
                eye-popping blunder; but Anderson has done it&#8221;).</font><br>
