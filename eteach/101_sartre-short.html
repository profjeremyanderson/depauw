                    [5] ...What, then, is this that we call
                    existentialism? </span><br style="font-family:

                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[6] Most of those
                    who are making use of this word would be highly
                    confused if required to explain its meaning. For
                    since it has become fashionable, people cheerfully
                    declare that this musician or that painter is
                    "existentialist." A columnist in Clartes signs
                    himself "The Existentialist," and, indeed, the word
                    is now so loosely applied to so many things that it
                    no longer means anything at all. It would appear
                    that, for the lack of any novel doctrine such as
                    that of surrealism, all those who are eager to join
                    in the latest scandal or movement now seize upon
                    this philosophy in which, however, they can find
                    nothing to their purpose. </span><br
                    style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[7] For in truth
                    this is of all teachings the least scandalous and
                    the most austere: it is intended strictly for
                    technicians and philosophers. All the same, it can
                    easily be defined. The question is only complicated
                    because there are two kinds of existentialists.
                    There are, on the one hand, the Christians, amongst
                    whom I shall name Jaspers and Gabriel Marcel, both
                    professed Catholics; and on the other the
                    existential atheists, amongst whom we must place
                    Heidegger as well as the French existentialists and
                    myself. What they have in common is simply the fact
                    that they believe t</span><span style="font-family:
                    Georgia;">hat <span style="font-style: italic;">existence

                    </span>comes before <span style="font-style:
                      italic;">essence </span>-- or, if y</span></font><font
                  size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">ou will,
                    that we must begin from the subjective. </span><br
                    style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[8] What exactly
                    do we mean by that? If one considers an article of
                    manufacture as, for example, a book or a paper-knife
                    -- one sees that it has been made by an artisan who
                    had a conception of it; and he has paid attention,
                    equally, to the conception of a paper-knife and to
                    the pre-existent technique of production which is a
                    part of that conception and is, at bottom, a
                    formula. Thus the paper-knife is at the same time an
                    article producible in a certain manner and one
                    which, on the other hand, serves a definite purpose,
                    for one cannot suppose that a man would produce a
                    paper-knife without knowing what it was for. Let us
                    say, then, of the paper-knife that its essence --
                    that is to say the sum of the formulae and the
                    qualities which made its production and its
                    definition possible -- precedes its existence. The
                    presence of such-and-such a paper-knife or book is
                    thus determined before my eyes. Here, then, we are
                    viewing the world from a technical standpoint, and
                    we can say that production precedes existence. </span><br
                    style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[9] When we think
                    of God as the creator, we are thinking of him, most
                    of the time, as a supernal artisan. Whatever
                    doctrine we may be considering, whether it be a
                    doctrine like that of Descartes, or of Leibnitz
                    himself, we always imply that the will follows, more
                    or less, from the understanding or at least
                    accompanies it, so that when God creates he knows
                    precisely what he is creating. Thus, the conception
                    of man in the mind of God is comparable to that of
                    the paper-knife in the mind of the artisan: God
                    makes man according to a procedure and a conception,
                    exactly as the artisan manufactures a paper-knife,
                    following a definition and a formula. Thus each
                    individual man is the realization of a certain
                    conception which dwells in the divine understanding.
                  </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[10] In the
                    philosophic atheism of the eighteenth century, the
                    notion of God is suppressed, but not, for all that,
                    the idea that essence is prior to existence;
                    something of that idea we still find everywhere, in
                    Diderot, in Voltaire and even in Kant. Man possesses
                    a human nature; that "human nature," which is the
                    conception of human being, is found in every man;
                    which means that each man is a particular example of
                    a universal conception, the conception of Man. In
                    Kant, this universality goes so far that the wild
                    man of the woods, man in the state of nature and the
                    bourgeois are all contained in the same definition
                    and have the same fundamental qualities. Here again,
                    the essence of man precedes that historic existence
                    which we confront in experience. </span><br
                    style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[11] Atheistic
                    existentialism, of which I am a representative,
                    declares with greater consistency that if God does
                    not exist there is at least one being whose
                    existence comes before its essence, a being which
                    exists before it can be defined by any conception of
                    it. That being is man or, as Heidegger has it, the
                    human reality. What do we mean by saying that
                    existence precedes essence? We mean that man first
                    of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the
                    world -- and defines himself afterwards. If man as
                    the existentialist sees him is not definable, it is
                    because to begin with he is nothing. He will not be
                    anything until later, and then he will be what he
                    makes of himself. Thus, there is no human nature,
                    because there is no God to have a conception of it.
                    Man simply is. Not that he is simply what he
                    conceives himself to be, but he is what he wills,
                    and as he conceives himself after already existing
                    -- as he wills to be after that leap towards
                    existence. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[12] Man is
                    nothing else but that which he makes of himself.
                    That is the first principle of existentialism. And
                    this is what people call its "subjectivity," using
                    the word as a reproach against us. But what do we
                    mean to say by this, but that man is of a greater
                    dignity than a stone or a table? For we mean to say
                    that man primarily exists -- that man is, before all
                    else, something which propels itself towards b a
                    future and is aware that it is doing so. Man is,
                    indeed, a project which possesses a subjective life,
                    instead of being a kind of moss, or a fungus or a
                    cauliflower. Before that projection of the self
                    nothing exists; not even in the heaven of
                    intelligence: man will only attain existence when he
                    is what he purposes to be. Not, however, what he may
                    wish to be. For what we usually understand by
                    wishing or willing is a conscious decision taken --
                    much more often than not -- after we have made
                    ourselves what we are. I may wish to join a party,
                    to write a book or to marry -- but in such a case
                    what is usually called my will is probably a
                    manifestation of a prior and more spontaneous
                    decision. If, however, it is true that existence is
                    prior to essence, man is responsible for what he is.
                    Thus, the first effect of existentialism is that it
                    puts every man in possession of himself as he is,
                    and places the entire responsibility for his
                    existence squarely upon his own shoulders. And, when
                    we say that man is responsible for himself, we do
                    not mean that he is responsible only for his own
                    individuality, but that he is responsible for all
                    men. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[13] The word
                    "subjectivism" is to be understood in two senses,
                    and our adversaries play upon only one of them.
                    Subjectivism means, on the one hand, the freedom of
                    the individual subject and, on the other, that man
                    cannot pass beyond human subjectivity. It is the
                    latter which is the deeper meaning of
                    existentialism. When we say that man chooses
                    himself, we do mean that every one of us must choose
                    himself; but by that we also mean that in choosing
                    for himself he chooses for all men. For in effect,
                    of all the actions a man may take in order to create
                    himself as he wills to be, there is not one which is
                    not creative, at the same time, of an image of man
                    such as he believes he ought to be. To choose
                    between this or that is at the same time to affirm
                    the value of that which is chosen; for we are unable
                    ever to choose the worse. What we choose is always
                    the better; and nothing can be better for us unless
                    it is better for all. </span><br

                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[14] If, moreover,
                    existence precedes essence and we will to exist at
                    the same time as we fashion our image, that image is
                    valid for all and for the entire epoch in which we
                    find ourselves. Our responsibility is thus much
                    greater than we had supposed, for it concerns
                    mankind as a whole. If I am a worker, for instance,
                    I may choose to join a Christian rather than a
                    Communist trade union. And if, by that membership, I
                    choose to signify that resignation is, after all,
                    the attitude that best becomes a man, that man's
                    kingdom is not upon this earth, I do not commit
                    myself alone to that view. Resignation is my will
                    for everyone, and my action is, in consequence, a
                    commitment on behalf of all mankind. Or if, to take
                    a more personal case, I decide to marry and to have
                    children, even though this decision proceeds simply
                    from my situation, from my passion or my desire, I
                    am thereby committing not only myself, but humanity
                    as a whole, to the practice of monogamy. I am thus
                    responsible for myself and for all men, and I am
                    creating a certain image of man as I would have him
                    to be. In fashioning myself I fashion man. </span><br

                    enable us to understand what is meant by such terms

                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">despair</span>. As

                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[16] First, what
                    do we mean by <span style="font-weight: bold;">anguish</span>?
                    The existentialist frankly states that man is in
                    anguish. His meaning is as follows. When a man
                    commits himself to anything, fully realizing that he
                    is not only choosing what he will be, but is thereby
                    at the same time a legislator deciding for the whole
                    of mankind -- in such a moment a man cannot escape
                    from the sense of complete and profound
                    responsibility. There are many, indeed, who show no
                    such anxiety. But we affirm that they are merely
                    disguising their anguish or are in flight from it.
                    Certainly, many people think that in what they are
                    doing they commit no one but themselves to anything:
                    and if you ask them, "What would happen if everyone
                    did so?" they shrug their shoulders and reply,
                    "Everyone does not do so." But in truth, one ought
                    always to ask oneself what would happen if everyone
                    did as one is doing; nor can one escape from that
                    disturbing thought except by a kind of
                    self-deception. The man who lies in self-excuse, by
                    saying "Everyone will not do it" must be ill at ease
                    in his conscience, for the act of lying implies the
                    universal value which it denies. </span><br
                    style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[17] By its very
                    disguise his anguish reveals itself. This is the
                    anguish that Kierkegaard called "the anguish of
                    Abraham." You know the story: An angel commanded
                    Abraham to sacrifice his son: and obedience was
                    obligatory, if it really was an angel who had
                    appeared and said, "Thou, Abraham, shalt sacrifice
                    thy son." But anyone in such a case would wonder,
                    first, whether it was indeed an angel and secondly,
                    whether I am really Abraham. Where are the proofs? A
                    certain mad woman who suffered from hallucinations
                    said that people were telephoning to her, and giving
                    her orders. The doctor asked, "But who is it that
                    speaks to you?" She replied: "He says it is God."
                    And what, indeed, could prove to her that it was
                    God? If an angel appears to me, what is the proof
                    that it is an angel; or, if I hear voices, who can
                    prove that they proceed from heaven and not from
                    hell, or from my own subconsciousness or some
                    pathological condition? Who can prove that they are
                    really addressed to me? Who, then, can prove that I
                    am the proper person to impose, by my own choice, my
                    conception of man upon mankind? I shall never find
                    any proof whatever; there will be no sign to
                    convince me of it. If a voice speaks to me, it is
                    still I myself who must decide whether the voice is
                    or is not that of an angel. If I regard a certain
                    course of action as good, it is only I who choose to
                    say that it is good and not bad. </span><br
                    style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[18] There is
                    nothing to show that I am Abraham: nevertheless I
                    also am obliged at every instant to perform actions
                    which are examples. Everything happens to every man
                    as though the whole human race had its eyes fixed
                    upon what he is doing and regulated its conduct
                    accordingly. So every man ought to say, "Am I really
                    a man who has the right to act in such a manner that
                    humanity regulates itself by what I do?" If a man
                    does not say that, he is dissembling his anguish. </span><br
                    style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[19] Clearly, the
                    anguish with which we are concerned here is not one
                    that could lead to quietism or inaction. It is
                    anguish pure and simple, of the kind well known to
                    all those who have borne responsibilities. When, for
                    instance, a military leader takes upon himself the
                    responsibility for the attack and sends a number of
                    men to their death, he chooses to do it and at
                    bottom he alone chooses. No doubt under a higher
                    command, but its orders, which are more general,
                    require interpretation by him and upon that
                    interpretation depends the life of ten, fourteen or
                    twenty men. In making the decision, he cannot but
                    feel a certain anguish. All leaders know that
                    anguish. It does not prevent their acting, on the
                    contrary it is the very condition of their action,
                    for the action presupposes that there is a plurality
                    of possibilities, and in choosing one of these, they
                    realize that it has value only because it is chosen.
                    Now it is anguish of that kind which existentialism
                    describes, and moreover, as we shall see, it makes
                    explicit the direct responsibility towards other men
                    who are concerned. Far from being a screen which
                    could separate us from action, it is a condition of
                    action itself. </span><br style="font-family:

                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[20] And when we
                    speak of "<span style="font-weight: bold;">abandonment</span>"
                    -- a favorite word of Heidegger -- we only mean to
                    say that God does not exist, and that it is
                    necessary to draw the consequences of his absence
                    right to the end. The existentialist is strongly
                    opposed to a certain type of secular moralism which
                    seeks to suppress God at the least possible expense.
                    Towards 1880, when the French professors endeavored
                    to formulate a secular morality, they said something
                    like this: God is a useless and costly hypothesis,
                    so we will do without it. However, if we are to have
                    morality, a society and a law-abiding world, it is
                    essential that certain values should be taken
                    seriously; they must have an </span><i
                    style="font-family: Georgia;">a priori</i><span
                    style="font-family: Georgia;"> existence ascribed to
                    them. It must be considered obligatory </span><i
                    style="font-family: Georgia;">a priori</i><span
                    style="font-family: Georgia;"> to be honest, not to
                    lie, not to beat one's wife, to bring up children
                    and so forth; so we are going to do a little work on
                    this subject, which will enable us to show that
                    these values exist all the same, inscribed in an
                    intelligible heaven although, of course, there is no
                    God. In other word -- and this is, I believe, the
                    purport of all that we in France call radicalism --
                    nothing will be changed if God does not exist; we
                    shall rediscover the same norms of honesty, progress
                    and humanity, and we shall have disposed of God as
                    an out-of-date hypothesis which will die away
                    quietly of itself. </span><br style="font-family:

                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[21] The
                    existentialist, on the contrary, finds it extremely
                    embarrassing that God does not exist, for there
                    disappears with Him all possibility of finding
                    values in an intelligible heaven. There can no
                    longer be any good </span><i style="font-family:
                    Georgia;">a priori</i><span style="font-family:
                    Georgia;">, since there is no infinite and perfect
                    consciousness to think it. It is nowhere written
                    that "the good" exists, that one must be honest or
                    must not lie, since we are now upon the plane where
                    there are only men. Dostoevsky once wrote, "If God
                    didn't exist, everything would be permitted"; and
                    that, for existentialism, is the starting point.
                    Everything is indeed permitted if God does not
                    exist, and man is in consequence forlorn, for he
                    cannot find anything to depend upon either within or
                    outside himself. He discovers forthwith, that he is
                    without excuse. </span><br style="font-family:
                    Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[22] For if indeed
                    existence precedes essence, one will never be able
                    to explain one's action by reference to a given and
                    specific human nature; in other words, there is no
                    determinism -- man is free, man </span><i
                    style="font-family: Georgia;">is</i><span
                    style="font-family: Georgia;"> freedom. Nor, on the
                    other hand, if God does not exist, are we provided
                    with any values or commands that could legitimize
                    our behavior. Thus we have neither behind us, nor
                    before us in a luminous realm of values, any means
                    of justification or excuse. -- We are left alone,
                    without excuse. </span><br style="font-family:
                    Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[23] That is what
                    I mean when I say that man is condemned to be free.
                    Condemned, because he did not create himself, yet is
                    nevertheless at liberty, and from the moment that he
                    is thrown into this world he is responsible for
                    everything he does. The existentialist does not
                    believe in the power of passion. He will never
                    regard a grand passion as a destructive torrent upon
                    which a man is swept into certain actions as by
                    fate, and which, therefore, is an excuse for them.
                    He thinks that man is responsible for his passion.
                    Neither will an existentialist think that a man can
                    find help through some sign being vouchsafed upon
                    earth for his orientation: for he thinks that the
                    man himself interprets the sign as he chooses. He
                    thinks that every man, without any support or help
                    whatever, is condemned at every instant to invent
                    man. As Ponge has written in a very fine article,
                    "Man is the future of man." That is exactly true.
                    Only, if one took this to mean that the future is
                    laid up in Heaven, that God knows what it is, it
                    would be false, for then it would no longer even be
                    a future. If, however, it means that, whatever man
                    may now appear to be, there is a future to be
                    fashioned, a virgin future that awaits him -- then
                    it is a true saying. But in the present one is
                    forsaken. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[24] As an example
                    by which you may the better understand this state of
                    abandonment, I will refer to the case of a pupil of
                    mine, who sought me out in the following
                    circumstances. His father was quarreling with his
                    mother and was also inclined to be a "collaborator";
                    his elder brother had been killed in the German
                    offensive of 1940 and this young man, with a
                    sentiment somewhat primitive but generous, burned to
                    avenge him. His mother was living alone with him,
                    deeply afflicted by the semi-treason of his father
                    and by the death of her eldest son, and her one
                    consolation was in this young man. But he, at this
                    moment, had the choice between going to England to
                    join the Free French Forces or of staying near his
                    mother and helping her to live. He fully realized
                    that this woman lived only for him and that his
                    disappearance -- or perhaps his death -- would
                    plunge her into despair. He also realized that,
                    concretely and in fact, every action he performed on
                    his mother's behalf would be sure of effect in the
                    sense of aiding her to live, whereas anything he did
                    in order to go and fight would be an ambiguous
                    action which might vanish like water into sand and
                    serve no purpose. For instance, to set out for
                    England he would have to wait indefinitely in a
                    Spanish camp on the way through Spain; or, on
                    arriving in England or in Algiers he might be put
                    into an office to fill up forms. </span><br
                    style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[25] Consequently,
                    he found himself confronted by two very different
                    modes of action; the one concrete, immediate, but
                    directed towards only one individual; and the other
                    an action addressed to an end infinitely greater, a
                    national collectivity, but for that very reason
                    ambiguous -- and it might be frustrated on the way.
                    At the same time, he was hesitating between two
                    kinds of morality; on the one side the morality of
                    sympathy, of personal devotion and, on the other
                    side, a morality of wider scope but of more
                    debatable validity. He had to choose between those
                    two. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[26] What could
                    help him to choose? Could the Christian doctrine?
                    No. Christian doctrine says: Act with charity, love
                    your neighbor, deny yourself for others, choose the
                    way which is hardest, and so forth. But which is the
                    harder road? To whom does one owe the more brotherly
                    love, the patriot or the mother? Which is the more
                    useful aim, the general one of fighting in and for
                    the whole community, or the precise aim of helping
                    one particular person to live? Who can give an
                    answer to that </span><i style="font-family:
                    Georgia;">a priori</i><span style="font-family:
                    Georgia;">? No one. Nor is it given in any ethical
                    scripture. The Kantian ethic says, Never regard
                    another as a means, but always as an end. Very well;
                    if I remain with my mother, I shall be regarding her
                    as the end and not as a means: but by the same token
                    I am in danger of treating as means those who are
                    fighting on my behalf; and the converse is also
                    true, that if I go to the aid of the combatants I
                    shall be treating them as the end at the risk of
                    treating my mother as a means. </span><br

                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[27] If values are
                    uncertain, if they are still too abstract to
                    determine the particular, concrete case under
                    consideration, nothing remains but to trust in our
                    instincts. That is what this young man tried to do;
                    and when I saw him he said, "In the end, it is
                    feeling that counts; the direction in which it is
                    really pushing me is the one I ought to choose. If I
                    feel that I love my mother enough to sacrifice
                    everything else for her -- my will to be avenged,
                    all my longings for action and adventure then I stay
                    with her. If, on the contrary, I feel that my love
                    for her is not enough, I go." </span><br
                    style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[28] But how does
                    one estimate the strength of a feeling? The value of
                    his feeling for his mother was determined precisely
                    by the fact that he was standing by her. I may say
                    that I love a certain friend enough to sacrifice
                    such or such a sum of money for him, but I cannot
                    prove that unless I have done it. I may say, "I love
                    my mother enough to remain with her," if actually I
                    have remained with her. I can only estimate the
                    strength of this affection if I have performed an
                    action by which it is defined and ratified. But if I
                    then appeal to this affection to justify my action,
                    I find myself drawn into a vicious circle. </span><br
                    style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[29] Moreover, as
                    Gide has very well said, a sentiment which is
                    play-acting and one which is vital [authentic,
                    sincere] are two things that are hardly
                    distinguishable one from another. To decide that I
                    love my mother by staying beside her, and to play a
                    comedy the upshot of which is that I do so -- these
                    are nearly the same thing. In other words, feeling
                    is formed by the deeds that one does; therefore I
                    cannot consult it as a guide to action. And that is
                    to say that I can neither seek within myself for an
                    authentic impulse to action, nor can I expect, from
                    some ethic, formulae that will enable me to act. You
                    may say that the youth did, at least, go to a
                    professor to ask for advice. But if you seek counsel
                    -- from a priest, for example -- you have selected
                    that priest; and at bottom you already knew, more or
                    less, what he would advise. In other words, to
                    choose an adviser is nevertheless to commit oneself
                    by that choice. If you are a Christian, you will
                    say, Consult a priest; but there are
                    collaborationists, priests who are resisters and
                    priests who wait for the tide to turn: which will
                    you choose? Had this young man chosen a priest of
                    the resistance, or one of the collaboration, he
                    would have decided beforehand the kind of advice he
                    was to receive. Similarly, in coming to me, he knew
                    what advice I should give him, and I had but one
                    reply to make. You are free, therefore choose, that
                    is to say, invent. </span><br style="font-family:

                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[30] No rule of
                    general morality can show you what you ought to do:
                    no signs are vouchsafed in this world. The Catholics
                    will reply, "Oh, but they are!" Very well; still, it
                    is I myself, in every case, who have to interpret
                    the signs. While I was imprisoned, I made the
                    acquaintance of a somewhat remarkable man, a Jesuit,
                    who had become a member of that order in the
                    following manner. In his life he had suffered a
                    succession of rather severe setbacks. His father had
                    died when he was a child, leaving him in poverty,
                    and he had been awarded a free scholarship in a
                    religious institution, where he had been made
                    continually to feel that he was accepted for
                    charity's sake, and, in consequence, he had been
                    denied several of those distinctions and honors
                    which gratify children. Later, about the age of
                    eighteen, he came to grief in a sentimental affair;
                    and finally, at twenty-two -- this was a trifle in
                    itself, but it was the last drop that overflowed his
                    cup -- he failed in his military examination. This
                    young man, then, could regard himself as a total
                    failure: it was a sign -- but a sign of what? He
                    might have taken refuge in bitterness or despair.
                    But he took it -- very cleverly for him -- as a sign
                    that he was not intended for secular success, and
                    that only the attainments of religion, those of
                    sanctity and of faith, were accessible to him. He
                    interpreted his record as a message from God, and
                    became a member of the Order. Who can doubt but that
                    this decision as to the meaning of the sign was his,
                    and his alone? One could have drawn quite different
                    conclusions from such a series of reverses -- as,
                    for example, that he had better become a carpenter
                    or a revolutionary. For the decipherment of the
                    sign, however, he bears the entire responsibility.
                    That is what "abandonment" implies, that we
                    ourselves decide our being. And with this
                    abandonment goes anguish. </span><br

                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[31] As for "<span
                      style="font-weight: bold;">despair</span>," the
                    meaning of this expression is extremely simple. It
                    merely means that we limit ourselves to a reliance
                    upon that which is within our wills, or within the
                    sum of the probabilities which render our action
                    feasible. Whenever one wills anything, there are
                    always these elements of probability. If I am
                    counting upon a visit from a friend, who may be
                    coming by train or by tram, I presuppose that the
                    train will arrive at the appointed time, or that the
                    tram will not be derailed. I remain in the realm of
                    possibilities; but one does not rely upon any
                    possibilities beyond those that are strictly
                    concerned in one's action. Beyond the point at which
                    the possibilities under consideration cease to
                    affect my action, I ought to disinterest myself. For
                    there is no God and no prevenient design, which can
                    adapt the world and all its possibilities to my
                    will. When Descartes said, "Conquer yourself rather
                    than the world," what he meant was, at bottom, the
                    same -- that we should act without hope. </span><br

                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[32] Marxists, to
                    whom I have said this, have answered: "Your action
                    is limited, obviously, by your death; but you can
                    rely upon the help of others. That is, you can count
                    both upon what the others are doing to help you
                    elsewhere, as in China and in Russia, and upon what
                    they will do later, after your death, to take up
                    your action and carry it forward to its final
                    accomplishment which will be the revolution.
                    Moreover you must rely upon this; not to do so is
                    immoral." To this I rejoin, first, that I shall
                    always count upon my comrades-in-arms in the
                    struggle, in so far as they are committed, as I am,
                    to a definite, common cause; and in the unity of a
                    party or a group which I can more or less control --
                    that is, in which I am enrolled as a militant and
                    whose movements at every moment are known to me. In
                    that respect, to rely upon the unity and the will of
                    the party is exactly like my reckoning that the
                    train will run to time or that the tram will not be
                    derailed. But I cannot count upon men whom I do not
                    know, I cannot base my confidence upon human
                    goodness or upon man's interest in the good of
                    society, seeing that man is free and that there is
                    no human nature which I can take as foundational. I
                    do not know where the Russian revolution will lead.
                    I can admire it and take it as an example in so far
                    as it is evident, today, that the proletariat plays
                    a part in Russia which it has attained in no other
                    nation. But I cannot affirm that this will
                    necessarily lead to the triumph of the proletariat:
                    I must confine myself to what I can see. </span><br

                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[33] Nor can I be
                    sure that comrades-in-arms will take up my work
                    after my death and carry it to the maximum
                    perfection, seeing that those men are free agents
                    and will freely decide, tomorrow, what man is then
                    to be. Tomorrow, after my death, some men may decide
                    to establish Fascism, and the others may be so
                    cowardly or so slack as to let them do so. If so,
                    Fascism will then be the truth of man, and so much
                    the worse for us. </span><br style="font-family:

                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[34] In reality,
                    things will be such as men have decided they shall
                    be. Does that mean that I should abandon myself to
                    quietism? No. First I ought to commit myself and
                    then act my commitment, according to the
                    time-honored formula that "one need not hope in
                    order to undertake one's work." Nor does this mean
                    that I should not belong to a party, but only that I
                    should be without illusion and that I should do what
                    I can. For instance, if I ask myself "Will the
                    social ideal as such, ever become a reality?" I
                    cannot tell, I only know that whatever may be in my
                    power to make it so, I shall do; beyond that, I can
                    count upon nothing. Quietism is the attitude of
                    people who say, "let others do what I cannot do."
                    The doctrine I am presenting before you is precisely
                    the opposite of this, since it declares that there
                    is no reality except in action. It goes further,
                    indeed, and adds, "Man is nothing else but what he
                    purposes, he exists only in so far as he realizes
                    himself, he is therefore nothing else but the sum of

                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[35] Hence we can
                    well understand why some people are horrified by our
                    teaching. For many have but one resource to sustain
                    them in their misery, and that is to think,
                    "Circumstances have been against me, I was worthy to
                    be something much better than I have been. I admit I
                    have never had a great love or a great friendship;
                    but that is because I never met a man or a woman who
                    were worthy of it; if I have not written any very
                    good books, it is because I had not the leisure to
                    do so; or, if I have had no children to whom I could
                    devote myself it is because I did not find the man I
                    could have lived with. So there remains within me a
                    wide range of abilities, inclinations and
                    potentialities, unused but perfectly viable, which
                    endow me with a worthiness that could never be
                    inferred from the mere history of my actions." But
                    in reality and for the existentialist, there is no
                    love apart from the deeds of love; no potentiality
                    of love other than that which is manifested in
                    loving; there is no genius other than that which is
                    expressed in works of art. The genius of Proust is
                    the totality of the works of Proust; the genius of
                    Racine is the series of his tragedies, outside of
                    which there is nothing. Why should we attribute to
                    Racine the capacity to write yet another tragedy
                    when that is precisely what he -- did not write? In
                    life, a man commits himself, draws his own portrait
                    and there is nothing but that portrait. No doubt
                    this thought may seem comfortless to one who has not
                    made a success of his life. On the other hand, it
                    puts everyone in a position to understand that
                    reality alone is reliable; that dreams, expectations
                    and hopes serve to define a man only as deceptive
                    dreams, abortive hopes, expectations unfulfilled;
                    that is to say, they define him negatively, not
                    positively. Nevertheless, when one says, "You are
                    nothing else but what you live," it does not imply
                    that an artist is to be judged solely by his works
                    of art, for a thousand other things contribute no
                    less to his definition as a man. What we mean to say
                    is that a man is no other than a series of
                    undertakings, that he is the sum, the organization,
                    the set of relations that constitute these
                    undertakings. </span><br style="font-family:

                    departure is, indeed, the subjectivity of the
                    individual, and that for strictly philosophic
                    reasons. It is not because we are bourgeois, but
                    because we seek to base our teaching upon the truth,
                    and not upon a collection of fine theories, full of
                    hope but lacking real foundations. And at the point
                    of departure there cannot be any other truth than

                    consciousness as it attains to itself. Every theory
                    which begins with man, outside of this moment of
                    self-attainment, is a theory which thereby
                    suppresses the truth, for outside of the Cartesian </span><i

                    style="font-family: Georgia;">, all objects are no
                    more than probable, and any doctrine of
                    probabilities which is not attached to a truth will
                    crumble into nothing. In order to define the
                    probable one must possess the true. Before there can
                    be any truth whatever, then, there must be an
                    absolute truth, and there is such a truth which is
                    simple, easily attained and within the reach of
                    everybody; it consists in one's immediate sense of
                    one's self. </span><br style="font-family:

                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[39] In the second
                    place, this theory alone is compatible with the
                    dignity of man, it is the only one which does not
                    make man into an object. All kinds of materialism
                    lead one to treat every man including oneself as an
                    object -- that is, as a set of pre-determined
                    reactions, in no way different from the patterns of
                    qualities and phenomena which constitute a table, or
                    a chair or a stone. Our aim is precisely to
                    establish the human kingdom as a pattern of values
                    in distinction from the material world. </span><br

                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[40] But the
                    subjectivity which we thus postulate as the standard
                    of truth is no narrowly individual subjectivism, for
                    as we have demonstrated, it is not only one's own
                    self that one discovers in the </span><i
                    style="font-family: Georgia;">cogito</i><span
                    style="font-family: Georgia;">, but those of others
                    too. Contrary to the philosophy of Descartes,
                    contrary to that of Kant, when we say "I think" we
                    are attaining to ourselves in the presence of the
                    other, and we are just as certain of the other as we
                    are of ourselves. Thus the man who discovers himself
                    directly in the </span><i style="font-family:
                    Georgia;">cogito</i><span style="font-family:
                    Georgia;"> also discovers all the others, and
                    discovers them as the condition of his own
                    existence. He recognizes that he cannot be anything
                    (in the sense in which one says one is spiritual, or
                    that one is wicked or jealous) unless others
                    recognize him as such. I cannot obtain any truth
                    whatsoever about myself, except through the
                    mediation of another. The other is indispensable to
                    my existence, and equally so to any knowledge I can
                    have of myself. Under these conditions, the intimate
                    discovery of myself is at the same time the
                    revelation of the other as a freedom which confronts
                    mine. and which cannot think or will without doing
                    so either for or against me. Thus, at once, we find
                    ourselves in a world which is, let us say, that of
                    "inter-subjectivity." It is in this world that man
                    has to decide what he is and what others are. </span><br

                    it quite clear that we are not propounding an
                    aesthetic morality, for our adversaries are
                    disingenuous enough to reproach us even with that. I
                    mention the work of art only by way of comparison.
                    That being understood, does anyone reproach an
                    artist, when he paints a picture, for not following
                    rules established </span><i style="font-family:
                    Georgia;">a priori</i><span style="font-family:
                    Georgia;">? Does one ever ask what is the picture
                    that he ought to paint? As everyone knows, there is
                    no pre-defined picture for him to make; the artist
                    applies himself to the composition of a picture, and
                    the picture that ought to be made is precisely that
                    which he will have made. As everyone knows, there
                    are no aesthetic values </span><i
                    style="font-family: Georgia;">a priori</i><span
                    style="font-family: Georgia;">, but there are values
                    which will appear in due course in the coherence of
                    the picture, in the relation between the will to
                    create and the finished work. No one can tell what
                    the painting of tomorrow will be like; one cannot
                    judge a painting until it is done. What has that to
                    do with morality? We are in the same creative
                    situation. We never speak of a work of art as
                    irresponsible; when we are discussing a canvas by
                    Picasso, we understand very well that the
                    composition became what it is at the time when he
                    was painting it, and that his works are part and
                    parcel of his entire life. </span><br

                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[45] It is the
                    same upon the plane of morality. There is this in
                    common between art and morality, that in both we
                    have to do with creation and invention. We cannot
                    decide </span><i style="font-family: Georgia;">a
                    priori</i><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> what
                    it is that should be done. I think it was made
                    sufficiently clear to you in the case of that
                    student who came to see me, that to whatever ethical
                    system he might appeal, the Kantian or any other, he
                    could find no sort of guidance whatever; he was
                    obliged to invent the law for himself. Certainly we
                    cannot say that this man, in choosing to remain with
                    his mother -- that is, in taking sentiment, personal
                    devotion and concrete charity as his moral
                    foundations -- would be making an irresponsible
                    choice, nor could we do so if he preferred the
                    sacrifice of going away to England. Man makes
                    himself; he is not found ready-made; he makes
                    himself by the choice of his morality, and he cannot
                    but choose a morality, such is the pressure of
                    circumstances upon him. We define man only in
                    relation to his commitments; it is therefore absurd
                    to reproach us for irresponsibility in our choice. </span><br

                    even ridiculed a certain type of humanism, why do
                    you now go back upon that?" In reality, the word
                    humanism has two very different meanings. One may
                    understand by humanism a theory which upholds man as
                    the end-in-itself and as the supreme value. Humanism
                    in this sense appears, for instance, in Cocteau's
                    story </span><i style="font-family: Georgia;">Round
                    the World in 80 Hours</i><span style="font-family:
                    Georgia;">, in which one of the characters declares,
                    because he is flying over mountains in an airplane,
                    "Man is magnificent!" This signifies that although
                    I, personally have not built airplanes I have the
                    benefit of those particular inventions and that I
                    personally, being a man, can consider myself
                    responsible for, and honored by, achievements that
                    are peculiar to some men. It is to assume that we
                    can ascribe value to man according to the most
                    distinguished deeds of certain men. That kind of
                    humanism is absurd, for only the dog or the horse
                    would be in a position to pronounce a general
                    judgment upon man and declare that he is
                    magnificent, which they have never been such fools
                    as to do -- at least, not as far as I know. But
                    neither is it admissible that a man should pronounce
                    judgment upon Man. Existentialism dispenses with any
                    judgment of this sort: an existentialist will never
                    take man as the end, since man is still to be
                    determined. And we have no right to believe that
                    humanity is something to which we could set up a
                    cult, after the manner of Auguste Comte. The cult of
                    humanity ends in Comtian humanism, shut -- in upon
                    itself, and -- this must be said -- in Fascism. We
                    do not want a humanism like that. </span><br

                    another sense of the word, of which the fundamental
                    meaning is this: Man is all the time outside of
                    himself: it is in projecting and losing himself
                    beyond himself that he makes man to exist; and, on
                    the other band, it is by pursuing transcendent aims
                    that he himself is able to exist. Since man is thus
                    self-surpassing, and can grasp objects only in
                    relation to his self-surpassing, he is himself the
                    heart and center of his transcendence. There is no
                    other universe except the human universe, the
                    universe of human subjectivity. This relation of
                    transcendence as constitutive of man (not in the
                    sense that God is transcendent, but in the sense of
                    self-surpassing) with subjectivity (in such a sense
                    that man is not shut up in himself but forever
                    present in a human universe) -- it is this that we
                    call existential humanism. This is humanism, because
                    we remind man that there is no legislator but
                    himself; that he himself, thus abandoned, must
                    decide for himself; also because we show that it is
                    not by turning back upon himself, but always by
                    seeking, beyond himself, an aim which is one of
                    liberation or of some particular realization, that
                    man can realize himself as truly human. </span><br

                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[52] You can see
                    from these few reflections that nothing could be
                    more unjust than the objections people raise against
                    us. Existentialism is nothing else but an attempt to
                    draw the full conclusions from a consistently
                    atheistic position. Its intention is not in the
                    least that of plunging men into despair. And if by
                    despair one means as the Christians do -- any
                    attitude of unbelief, the despair of the
                    existentialists is something different.
                    Existentialism is not atheist in the sense that it
                    would exhaust itself in demonstrations of the
                    non-existence of God. It declares, rather, that even
                    if God existed that would make no difference from
                    its point of view. Not that we believe God does
                    exist, but we think that the real problem is not
                    that of His existence; what man needs is to find
                    himself again and to understand that nothing can
                    save him from himself, not even a valid proof of the
                    existence of God. In this sense existentialism is
                    optimistic. It is a doctrine of action, and it is
                    only by self-deception, by confining their own
                    despair with ours that Christians can describe us as
                    without hope.</span></font></td>
