                acquaint you with some of the most important discussions
                in ethics (aka moral philosophy), such as: What basis
                (if any) do ethical rules have? What is the point of
                being ethical? What is &#8220;good&#8221;? You will learn about and
                critically evaluate some major schools of ethical
                thought, including consequentialist, deontological, and
                virtue ethics. By the end of the course you should have
                a critical appreciation for all of these and be able to
                employ these kinds of ethical reasoning.</font><br>

                  not count. Participating once per week, by whatever

                  credible sources which give a range of perspectives on
                  it, and integrate those perspectives into your
                  presentation. You may choose to cover a reading which

                  merge with the consciousness of another human being.
                  We possess the books we read, animating the waiting
                  stillness of their language, but they possess us also,
                  filling us with thoughts and observations, asking us
                  to make them part of ourselves.... In order for this
                  to work, however, we need a certain type of silence,

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One strategy for reading that has

                assignment carefully at least once, trying to make as
                much sense of it as you can. Then come to class and take
                good notes and participate (see below). Then, after
                class, read the assignment again. You should find it
                more comprehensible then. (If you don&#8217;t, come see me

                aren't worth asking or their comments not worth making,
                but often others wanted to say the same thing. Don&#8217;t
