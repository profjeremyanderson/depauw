                  <li>Cephalus and Polemarchus give several different
                    definitions of justice (i.e., acting rightly) in the
                    reading. We won't have time to discuss them all, so
                    look especially at Cephalus' definition (Plato, 5)
                    and Polemarchus' (bottom of p. 10 to top of
                    11--notice that it's different from his first one on
                    pp. 6-7). What are these definitions, and why does
                    Socrates reject each of them? Why do you think they
                    keep trying to define justice, despite it being so
                    hard?</li>
                  <li>What definition of "the just" does Thrasymachus
                    give (Plato, top of 15)? What does he mean by that,
                    and how does he argue for it (Plato, 15-22,
                    especially 21-22)?</li>
                  <li>Think about the contrast between Thrasymachus and
                    everyone else. How would you describe the
                    differences between them? In particular, how does
                    Thrasymachus's view of justice differ from everyone
                    else's?</li>

                suggests we are we so conditioned by culture that we

                    <li>The term "abnormal" is very important in
                      Benedict. "Abnormal" doesn't just mean "not
                      normal." When we say someone is "abnormal" we
                      often also mean there is something wrong with
                      them, and that their abnormality makes them less
                      fit for society. Benedict uses examples from
                      anthropology to argue that our judgments of what
                      is normal/abnormal, fit/unfit for society -- and
                      moral/immoral -- are products of our culture.</li>

                  <li>Why would Benedict object to the claims in the
                    National Security Strategy's opening paragraph? (It
                    may help to consider her opening paragraph, 1.)</li>
                  <li>Benedict presents several examples of cultural
                    practices very different from our own. These
                    examples fall into two categories: first, those
                    which show "the ease with which our abnormals
                    function in other cultures" (Benedict, 1; the
                    examples continue to the top of p. 3); second,
                    "those cultures where an abnormality of our culture
                    is the cornerstone of their social structure" (3;
                    the examples continue to p. 5). What does she mean
                    by this distinction? What does she want us to
                    conclude from the examples (5-6)?</li>
                  <li>What does Benedict mean when she says, "The very
                    eyes with which we see the problem are conditioned
                    by the long traditional habits of our own society"
                    (Benedict, 5)? </li>
                  <li>On page 6 Benedict says there is a "range of human
                    behavior that is found wherever a sufficiently large
                    series of individuals is observed. But the
                    proportion in which behavior types stand to one
                    another in different societies is not universal. The
                    vast majority of individuals in any group are shaped
                    to the fashion of that culture. In other words, most
                    individuals are plastic to the moulding force of the
                    society into which they are born." What does
                    Benedict mean by this?</li>

                  <li>The context for this reading is the conflict
                    between white supremacists and proponents of equal
                    rights in the United States in the mid-20th Century.
                    White supremacists wanted to maintain segregation of
                    races and the inferior status of Black people;
                    equal-rights proponents wanted integration and equal
                    status for Black people. How would a moral skeptic
                    view this disagreement? How would a moral
                    subjectivist? A cultural relativist? (This is not as
                    easy as it might seem; ask yourself, 'What is a
                    culture?') How about an ethical objectivist?</li>
                  <li>How does King distinguish "just" laws from
                    "unjust" laws (King, paragraphs 15-20)? Pay special
                    attention to paragraph 16.</li>
                  <li>Paragraph 14 describes how Black people in America
                    were treated under segregation. How does this relate
                    to what King says about just vs. unjust laws?</li>
                  <li>How persuasive is King at showing (a) there are at
                    least some objectively just and unjust laws, and (b)
                    we can tell what they are? For example, you might
                    think about how Benedict or Thrasymachus might
                    respond to King, and how good (or not) their
                    responses might be.</li>

                <ol>
                  <li>How does Aquinas argue that "it is natural" for
                    humans "to live in fellowship with many others" (<span
                      style="font-style: italic;">De Regno</span>, 1)?
                    How does he argue that "it is necessary for there to
                    be some means whereby such a community...may be
                    ruled" (Aquinas, <span style="font-style: italic;">De








                      Regno</span>, 1)?</li>
                  <li>Whose good is the law directed towards, according
                    to Aquinas (<span style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>,
                    2)? Why? (Hint: partly this is answered on p. 2, but
                    also in <span style="font-style: italic;">De Regno</span>,
                    1.)</li>
                  <li>Near the end of p. 4 Aquinas says "the first
                    precept of law, [is] that 'good is to be done and
                    promoted, and evil is to be avoided.'" In the text
                    immediately before this, how does Aquinas support
                    this claim? Focus on the two preceding sentences.</li>
                  <li>Aquinas discusses our "natural inclinations" and
                    several "precepts of natural law" (<span
                      style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>, 4-5).
                    What inclinations does Aquinas identify? How do the
                    precepts relate to those inclinations?</li>
                  <li>Starting on p. 5 in Article 4, Aquinas discusses
                    how the precepts of natural law are the same for
                    everyone but "conclusions of the practical reason"
                    (5 -- that is, particular human laws) may not apply
                    all the time. Why does Aquinas think that is so?</li>
                  <li>Bonus extra-hard question: In Question 91, Article
                    3, Aquinas draws an analogy between "speculative
                    reason" and "practical reason" (<span
                      style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>, 3). By
                    "speculative reason" he means abstract
                    sciences--think, for example, of geometry with its
                    axioms, from which we derive theorems. By "practical
                    reason" he means "figuring out what to do," such as
                    forming moral rules. Try to explain this analogy.
                    (This analogy helps explain how Aquinas thinks
                    "precepts of natural law" are more authoritative
                    than human-made laws.)</li>

                <ol>
                  <li>Glaucon and Socrates agree that there are three
                    sorts of goods--or, we might say, three different
                    ways in which things can be good (Plato, 36). What
                    are they? Think of examples besides the ones in the
                    text.</li>
                  <li>Glaucon describes (what he thinks most people
                    believe is) "what sort of thing people consider
                    justice to be, and what its origins are" (Plato,
                    37-8). According to this account, (a) what do people
                    like most? (b) what do people like least? (c) how
                    does this provide a sort of basis for moral rules?</li>
                  <li>Glaucon goes on to claim that "those who practice
                    [justice] do so unwillingly, because they lack the
                    power to do injustice" (Plato, 38-9). He illustrates
                    this with the story of the ring. How is the story
                    supposed to support his claim?</li>

                    13, Hobbes is describing what he calls the "natural
                    condition" of humanity, often called a "state of
                    nature." What he means by this is, "How humans would
                    be if there were no government": no police,
                    firefighters, written laws, etc. Within a couple of
                    pages he concludes that, in such a state, we'd be in
                    a "war, where every man is enemy to every man," and
                    our lives would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish,
                    and short" (Hobbes, 71). Carefully examine those
                    pages to see how he draws this conclusion. How does
                    he think we're equal? What comes from our equality?
                    Why can't we just get along peacefully with each
                    other?</li>
                  <li>In chapters 14 and 15, Hobbes states his first,
                    second, and third "laws of nature." Identify these
                    laws. How do the three of them arise from Hobbes's
                    account of our "natural condition"? In other words,
                    if Hobbes is right about our being miserable in a
                    state of nature, why would the laws make sense?</li>
                  <li>In Chapter 17 Hobbes explains why nothing short of
                    an absolute ruler ("sovereign") over a large group
                    ("multitude") of people can keep us safe. Why does
                    he think the alternatives are unacceptable?</li>

                <ol>
                  <li>Why has utilitarianism been called "a doctrine
                    worthy only of swine" (Mill, 1)?</li>
                  <li>How does Mill distinguish the two kinds of
                    pleasures (which we will call "higher" and "lower";
                    Mill, 1)? How does he argue that "It is better to be
                    a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied;
                    better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool
                    satisfied" (Mill, 2)? Are you persuaded?</li>
                  <li>Utilitarianism has been criticized for being "too
                    high for humanity"--i.e., it is too demanding (Mill,
                    5). How does Mill respond to this criticism? Compare
                    what Mill says there to what Bentham says in section
                    VI of his piece (Bentham, 4). </li>
                  <li>Critics of utilitarianism have complained that
                    "there is not time, previous to action, for
                    calculating and weighing the effects of any line of
                    conduct on the general happiness" (Mill, 6). If this
                    were true, why would this be a problem for
                    utilitarianism? How does Mill respond to this
                    complaint?</li>

                    for life (43-4)? If he is right that we would not
                    plug in, how might this imply a problem with
                    Utilitarianism? Do you agree it's a problem? (The
                    explainer video will be very helpful here.)</li>
                  <li>Given all the things Le Guin describes in Omelas,

                    if anything, does that suggest about Utilitarianism?</li>
                  <li>Bonus extra-subtle question which we might not
                    discuss in class but is interesting to think about:
                    Notice how the Le Guin keeps intruding into the
                    narrative, discussing her struggle to describe the
                    people of Omelas, asking "How is one to tell about
                    joy?" (Le Guin, 1; line 26), and repeatedly asking
                    "Do you believe?" (lines 104 and 172). What's that
                    about--what point is Le Guin making with these
                    intrusions? What might that tell us about
                    Utilitarianism?</li>

                  <li>Hospers gives several cases where consequentialism
                    seems to tell us to do something that seems wrong
                    (1-2). Why does consequentialism seem to go wrong in
                    these cases--what is its "fatal error" (3)? How
                    would rule-utilitarianism give a different answer in
                    these cases?</li>
                  <li>What is rule-utilitarianism (Hospers, 4)? How does
                    it differ from act-utilitarianism?</li>
                  <li>Hospers argues that simple, absolute rules would
                    be bad (8-9; see his discussion of violence and
                    killing). What reasons does he give for this? </li>
                  <li>Why does Hospers think rules like, "Always keep
                    your promises except when breaking them will produce
                    the most good" are bad (11, starting at #5 on p. 11
                    and including his discussion of killing on 11-12)?
                    So, what sort of rules does Hospers think we should
                    have? (See Hospers' other discussion of killing,
                    starting in the last paragraph of p. 8, where he
                    talks about specific exceptions.)</li>

                  <li>Williams has much to say about utilitarianism, but
                    we will focus on what makes Williams' critique
                    different. Others have found fault with
                    utilitarianism's theory of the good, or complained
                    that it tells us to do bad things to others.
                    Williams does some of these, too, but his
                    distinctive complaint is that trying to be
                    utilitarian is harmful to oneself. As you read
                    through the article, focus on what Williams has to
                    say about that.</li>

                  <li>Look at the cases of George and Jim (Williams,
                    3-4). What does Williams think is the right thing to
                    do in each case? What does utilitarianism say to do
                    in each case--and how does negative responsibility
                    play a role in each?</li>
                  <li>In the section titled "Integrity" (4-9), Williams
                    argues that following utilitarianism damages people.
                    He argues that it both tends to make you less happy
                    (6) and violates your integrity (7-8). Why does
                    Williams think these are so? Do you agree?</li>

                  <li>Singer has a thesis (230, last full paragraph), an
                    assumption (231, first full paragraph), and a
                    "point" (231, second paragraph)--which is really a
                    moral principle. What are they? Notice that he gives
                    two versions of the moral principle here; what are
                    they, and how do they differ?</li>
                  <li>If Singer is right, what does that imply about our
                    obligations to help the needy? How does that differ
                    from how we normally think about giving (Singer,
                    235)?</li>

                    Americans spend on "crap"? Based on his two
                    principles, what would Singer say we should do about
                    that?</li>
                  <li>If we followed Singer's moral principles, how
                    would that change how we live (Singer, 241-2)?

                    explicitly at utilitarianism, but some of them would
                    apply to most any form of consequentialism. And,

                Kant says this about the nature of moral laws and the
                proper sort of justification for them:<br>
                <br>
                <div style="margin-left: 40px;">That there must be [a
                  &#8220;pure&#8221; moral] philosophy is evident from the common
                  idea of duty and of moral laws. Everyone must admit
                  that if a law is to be morally valid, i.e., is to be
                  valid as a ground of obligation, then it must carry
                  with it absolute necessity. He must admit that the
                  command, &#8220;Thou shalt not lie,&#8221; does not hold only for
                  men, as if other rational beings had no need to abide
                  by it, and so with all the other moral laws properly
                  so called. And he must concede that the ground [i.e.,
                  justification] of obligation here must therefore be
                  sought not in the world in which man is placed, but
                  must be sought a priori solely in the concepts of pure
                  reason.... (Kant, 1)<br>

                    concepts of pure reason," what implications might
                    that have for, say, utilitarianism? How about for
                    cultural relativism, or Aquinas' or Hobbes's natural

                <ol>
                  <li>Why does Kant think our "inclinations" (our human
                    instincts, desires, fears, etc.) are not appropriate
                    guides to moral action (Kant, 1)?</li>
                  <li>Kant says we might think that only duty could have
                    motivated someone to do some moral act, but even
                    then "there cannot with certainty be at all inferred
                    from this that some secret impulse of self-love,
                    merely appearing as the idea of duty, was not the
                    actual determining cause of the will" (7). What do
                    you think he mean by this?</li>
                  <li>On pp. 3-4 Kant distinguishes between an action
                    which "accords with duty" and an action done "from
                    duty." What is the difference between them? Look at
                    Kant's examples of the dealer, the suicidal man and
                    the charitable man (3-4): do you agree there is an
                    important difference between doing something because
                    you are inclined to, and doing it just because it is
                    your duty?</li>

                  <li>Kant gives four famous examples of how to apply
                    FUL (Kant, 11-12). In "Kant's Four Examples,"
                    Feldman discusses and criticizes them (Feldman,
                    8-13). Then, in "More Examples," Feldman brings up
                    examples of his own which, he argues, present
                    problems for Kant (Feldman, 13-5). Of all these,
                    which do you think is the sharpest, most telling
                    example? Which is the least? How come?</li>
                  <li>Do you think Feldman has effectively shown that
                    there is a problem with the FUL? If so, might the
                    problem be fixed somehow? </li>

                    appears at the beginning of p. 14. The preceding
                    text is an argument for it, and the text after

                Kant says<br>
                <br>
                <div style="margin-left: 40px;">All the objects of
                  inclinations have only a conditioned value; for if
                  there were not these inclinations and the needs
                  founded on them, then their object would be without
                  value. But the inclinations themselves, being sources
                  of needs, are so far from having an absolute value
                  such as to render them desirable for their own sake
                  that the universal wish of every rational being must
                  be, rather to be wholly free from them. Accordingly
                  the value of any object obtainable by our action is
                  always conditioned.&nbsp; (Kant, 13)<br>
                </div>
                <ol>
                  <li>What does Kant mean by this? (It may be helpful to
                    think of an example of something you're "inclined"
                    to want, like money or a diploma or a nice house.)</li>
                  <li>Kant distinguishes between "subjective ends" and
                    "objective ends" (13--in both the left and right
                    columns). What does he mean by this distinction?
                    What does he mean by these terms?</li>
                  <li>O'Neill says Kant's "formula of the end in itself"
                    (also called the "formula of humanity") implies we
                    have two distinct duties: (a) "avoid acting on
                    maxims that use others as mere means" and (b) "act
                    on maxims that treat others as ends in themselves"
                    (423). How would one use another as a mere means
                    (423-4)? What must we do to treat others as ends
                    (424)--why may we not just leave others alone?</li>

                  <li>Ross discusses this situation: "If I have promised
                    to meet a friend at a particular time for some
                    trivial purpose, I should certainly think myself

                    could prevent a serious accident or bring relief to
                    the victims of one" (Ross, 2).</li>
                  <li>Ross criticizes how both Kantians and utilitarians
                    would handle this situation. What does he think is
                    wrong with Kantianism here? What does he think is
                    wrong with utilitarianism?</li>

                    How should you figure out what to do, according to
                    Ross? Does it seem easier, harder, or about the same
                    as, say, using act- or rule-utilitarianism or one of
                    Kant's formulas of the categorical imperative? What,
                    if anything, does that tell you about how Ross'

                  <li>Nielsen is confident we should blow up the fat
                    man--so confident that our intuitions say not to,
                    then he says our intuitions are "corrupt" (Nielsen,
                    229). But Ross argues we should stick with our
                    intuitions. What are Ross' reasons for this (9)?</li>

                  <li>How does Aristotle distinguish between "products
                    of a craft" and "actions expressing virtue" (4)?
                    Especially, what is required for actions expressing
                    virtue? (You might think of it this way: why might
                    we not say someone is virtuous if they lack those
                    things?)</li>
                  <li>What's the difference between a "numerical" mean
                    and a "mean relative to us" (5-6)? Why is it better
                    to choose what is intermediate "relative to us"?</li>
                  <li>What is Aristotle's definition of virtue (6,
                    &sect;15)? Pick one or two of the sample virtues on
                    7-8 and explain how they meet this definition. (The
                    Aristotelian Virtue Chart may be helpful for this.)</li>

                  <li>McMullen writes: &#8220;So who is more ethical: a vegan
                    whose diet prevents some animal suffering but also
                    prevents happy animals from existing, or the
                    omnivore whose diet brings some happy animals into
                    existence but causes other animals to suffer? The
                    logic asserting it is good to prevent the existence
                    of suffering animals by altering food choices also
                    dictates that it is good to make food choices that
                    bring happy animals into existence. Arguments to the
                    contrary are illogical.&#8221; (McMullen 180). Do you
                    agree with this argument by the economists? Is this
                    a sound argument given that this is one of the few
                    &#8220;assertive" stances that the economists take on in
                    their writing?</li>
                  <li>Please watch the video and give your reaction. Do
                    you eat meat, and if so, how does seeing the process
                    of factory farming impact your mindset?</li>
                  <li>Francione analyzes the thought process behind The
                    Animal Welfare Position. How do the cognitive
                    difference between animals and humans support the
                    arguments behind this position? (Francione, 25-26)</li>
                  <li>How does this differ from the arguments of

                <ol>
                  <li>According to Teetzel, why is it difficult to
                    measure how hormones affect the athletic performance
                    of transgender athletes? Specifically, what problems
                    arise when trying to research a transgender
                    athlete&#8217;s performance before and after undergoing
                    hormone treatments (166)?</li>
                  <li>Why is requiring transgender women to undergo
                    surgery in order to compete controversial (Teetzel,
                    164)?</li>
                  <li>Teetzel mentions that "at every level of sport,
                    the only way to avoid defining essential
                    characteristics of women and men is to eradicate sex
                    categories entirely, or to trust participants to
                    self-select the category in which they will compete"
                    (161). Sports have been divided by gender for ages.
                    This is a fact that everyone has accepted for many
                    reasons, one being that there is a significant
                    biological difference between men and women. What
                    are the ethical implications of separating men and
                    women in sports? Do you believe that it is possible
                    to "eradicate sex categories entirely" and that the
                    eradication would make sports more ethical (Teetzel,
                    161)?</li>

                    shocking to you? Why or why not?</li>

                    figures/politicians like Caitlyn Jenner weighing in
                    their opinion on whether or not transgender women
                    should compete with biologically-born women? What
                    are some dangers, if any, of making transgender
                    issues political?</li>
