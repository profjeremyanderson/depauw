        Excerpt</h3>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">The following is
          taken from Immanuel Kant&#8217;s <i>The Metaphysics of Morals </i>(Part





          II, &#8220;The Science of Right&#8221;), translated by W. Hastie with
          emendations and paragraph numbers added by Jeremy Anderson. <a

            Kant's text is available free online here</a>. </font></div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">In this excerpt,
          Kant first explains what crime is and the different sorts of
          crimes (paragraph 1). He then presents his view that
          punishment is justified by the criminal's having committed a
          crime (par. 2). This is to be contrasted with other theories
          of punishment such as the Utilitarian theory, according to
          which punishment is justified by the good it brings to
          society. Kant rejects the Utilitarian theory for two reasons.
          First, he believes it treats criminals as mere means to
          others' good; Kant&#8217;s Categorical Imperative forbids this.
          Second, the Utilitarian theory could, possibly, justify
          punishing an innocent person because of the good it might
          bring to society or allow a guilty person to escape just
          punishment (this is the case Kant considers in par. 2, where
          he rejects the proposal that a man be subjected to medical
          experiments rather than punished). To Kant, this sort of
          injustice is absolutely intolerable. Having explained <i>why</i>
          we punish people Kant goes on to discuss <i>how</i> and <i>how





            much</i> to punish criminals (par. 3-8). Here he asserts
          that the hurt done to the criminal should equal the hurt the
          criminal did to others, both in <span style="font-style:
            italic;">amount </span>and in <span style="font-style:
            italic;">kind</span>. This is Kant's nearly literal version
          of the Biblical "eye for an eye" principle, referred to as <span
            style="font-style: italic;">jus talionis</span> or <span
            style="font-style: italic;">lex talionis</span>. The rest of
          the piece mostly explains what he means by this, with
          particular emphasis on the need for the death penalty. In
          paragraphs 8 and 10 Kant considers some interesting exceptions
          to the rule that murderers must be executed. </font><br>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">Although Kant is
          clearly a retributivist about how punishment is <span
            style="font-style: italic;">justified</span>, he allows that
          punishment may also be useful (some discussion of this is <a
href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-social-political/#Pun">here</a>.)</font><br>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">Kant makes some
          interesting claims. For example, he insists that nothing short
          of execution is just punishment for murder because "</font><font
          size="-1">There is no likeness or proportion between life,
          however painful, and death; and therefore there is no equality
          between the crime of murder and the retaliation of it but what
          is judicially accomplished by the execution of the criminal"
          (par. 6). Also, Kant says "</font><font size="-1">it is in
          fact no punishment when any one experiences what he wills"
          (par. 9). Do you agree with these claims? How come?</font> </p>

      <p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[1] The right of
          administering punishment is the right of the sovereign as the
          supreme power to inflict pain upon a subject on account of a
          crime committed by him. The head of the state cannot therefore
          be punished; but his supremacy may be withdrawn from him. Any
          transgression of the public law which makes him who commits it
          incapable of being a citizen, constitutes a crime, either
          simply as a private crime (<span style="font-style: italic;">crimen</span>),





          or also as a public crime (<span style="font-style: italic;">crimen





            publicum</span>). Private crimes are dealt with by a civil
          court; public crimes by a criminal court. Embezzlement or
          speculation of money or goods entrusted in trade, fraud in
          purchase or sale, if done before the eyes of the party who
          suffers, are private crimes. On the other hand, coining false
          money or forging bills of exchange, theft, robbery, etc., are
          public crimes, because the commonwealth, and not merely some
          particular individual, is endangered thereby. Such crimes may
          be divided into those of a base character (<span
            style="font-style: italic;">indolis abjectae</span>) and
          those of a violent character (<span style="font-style:
            italic;">indolis violentiae</span>). </font></p>
      <blockquote style="font-family: Georgia;"> </blockquote>
      <p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[2] Judicial or
          juridical punishment (<span style="font-style: italic;">poena
            forensis</span>) is to be distinguished from natural
          punishment (<span style="font-style: italic;">poena naturalis</span>),





          in which crime as vice punishes itself, and does not as such
          come within the cognizance of the legislator. Juridical
          punishment can never be administered merely as a means for
          promoting another good either with regard to the criminal
          himself or to civil society, but must in all cases be imposed
          only because the individual on whom it is inflicted has
          committed a crime. For one man ought never to be dealt with
          merely as a means subservient to the purpose of another, nor
          be mixed up with the subjects of real right. Against such
          treatment his inborn personality [i.e., his rational capacity]
          has a right to protect him, even although he may be condemned
          to lose his civil personality [i.e., his citizenship, liberty,
          property, or life]. He must first be found guilty and
          punishable, before there can be any thought of drawing from
          his punishment any benefit for himself or his fellow-citizens.
          The penal law is a categorical imperative; and woe to him who
          creeps through the serpent-windings of utilitarianism to
          discover some advantage that may discharge him from the
          justice of punishment, or even from the due measure of it,
          according to the Pharisaic maxim: "It is better that one man
          should die than that the whole people should perish." For if
          justice and righteousness perish, human life would no longer
          have any value in the world. What, then, is to be said of such
          a proposal as to keep a criminal alive who has been condemned
          to death, on his being given to understand that, if he agreed
          to certain dangerous experiments being performed upon him, he
          would be allowed to survive if he came happily through them?
          It is argued that physicians might thus obtain new information
          that would be of value to the commonweal. But a court of
          justice would repudiate with scorn any proposal of this kind
          if made to it by the medical faculty; for justice would cease
          to be justice, if it were bartered away for any consideration
          whatsoever. </font></p>
      <p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[3] But what is
          the mode and measure of punishment which public justice takes
          as its principle and standard? It is just the principle of
          equality, by which the pointer of the scale of justice is made
          to incline no more to the one side than the other. The
          undeserved evil which any one commits on another is to be
          regarded as perpetrated on himself. Hence it may be said: "If
          you slander another, you slander yourself; if you steal from
          another, you steal from yourself; if you strike another, you
          strike yourself; if you kill another, you kill yourself." This
          is the right of retaliation (<span style="font-style: italic;">jus</span>
          <span style="font-style: italic;">talionis</span>); and,
          properly understood, it is the only principle which in
          regulating a public court (as opposed to individuals&#8217; private
          judgement), can definitely assign both the quality and the
          quantity of a just penalty. All other standards are wavering
          and uncertain; and on account of other considerations involved
          in them, they contain no principle conformable to the sentence
          of pure and strict justice. </font></p>
      <p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[4] It may
          appear, however, that differences of social status would not
          admit the application of the principle of retaliation, which
          is that of "like with like." But although the application may
          not in all cases be possible according to the letter, yet as
          regards the effect it may always be attained in practice, by
          due regard being given to the disposition and sentiment of the
          parties in the higher social classes. Thus a monetary penalty
          on account of a verbal injury may have no direct proportion to
          the injustice of slander; for one who is wealthy may be able
          to indulge himself in this offence for his own gratification
          [and simply pay the fine, which is of no consequence to him].
          Yet the attack committed on the honour of the party aggrieved
          may have its equivalent in the pain inflicted upon the pride
          of the aggressor, especially if he is condemned by the
          judgement of the court, not only to retract and apologize, but
          to submit to some meaner ordeal, as kissing the hand of the
          injured person. In like manner, if a man of the highest rank
          has violently assaulted an innocent citizen of the lower
          orders, he may be condemned not only to apologize but to
          undergo a solitary and painful imprisonment, whereby, in
          addition to the discomfort endured, the vanity of the offender
          would be painfully affected, and the very shame of his
          position would constitute an adequate retaliation after the
          principle of "like with like." </font></p>
      <p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[5] But how then
          would we render the statement: "If you steal from another, you
          steal from yourself?" In this way: that whoever steals
          anything makes everyone&#8217;s property insecure; he therefore robs
          himself of all security in property, according to the right of
          retaliation. Such a one has nothing, and can acquire nothing,
          but he has the will to live; and this is only possible by
          others supporting him. But as the state should not support the
          thief for free, he must yield his powers to the state to be
          used in penal labour; and thus he falls for a time, or it may
          be for life, into a condition of slavery. </font></p>
      <p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[6] But whoever
          has committed murder, must die. There is, in this case, no
          juridical substitute or surrogate, that can be given or taken
          for the satisfaction of justice. There is no likeness or
          proportion between life, however painful, and death; and
          therefore there is no equality between the crime of murder and
          the retaliation of it but what is judicially accomplished by
          the execution of the criminal. His death, however, must be
          kept free from all maltreatment that would make the humanity
          suffering in his person loathsome or abominable. Even if a
          civil society resolved to dissolve itself with the consent of
          all its members--as might be supposed in the case of a people
          inhabiting an island resolving to separate and scatter
          themselves throughout the whole world--the last murderer lying
          in prison ought to be executed before the resolution was
          carried out. This ought to be done in order that every one may
          realize the desert of his deeds, and that blood-guiltiness may
          not remain upon the people; for otherwise they might all be
          regarded as participators in the murder as a public violation
          of justice. </font></p>
      <p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[7] The
          equalization of punishment with crime is therefore only
          possible by judicial sentence extending even to the penalty of
          death, according to the right of retaliation. This is manifest
          from the fact that it is only thus that a sentence can be
          pronounced over all criminals proportionate to their internal
          wickedness; as may be seen by considering the case when the
          punishment of death has to be inflicted, not on account of a
          murder, but on account of a political crime that can only be
          punished capitally. A hypothetical case, founded on history,
          will illustrate this. In the last Scottish rebellion there
          were various participators in it--such as Balmerino and
          others--who believed that in taking part in the rebellion they
          were only discharging their duty to the house of Stuart; but
          there were also others who were animated only by private
          motives and interests. Now, suppose that the judgement of the
          supreme court regarding them had been this: that every one
          should have liberty to choose between the punishment of death
          or penal servitude for life. In view of such an alternative, I
          say that the man of honour would choose death, and the knave
          would choose servitude. This would be the effect of their
          human nature as it is; for the honourable man values his
          honour more highly than even life itself, whereas a knave
          regards a life, although covered with shame, as better in his
          eyes than death. The former is less guilty [because he acted
          out of duty] than the other [who acted for his own gain]; and
          they [both] can only be proportionately punished by death
          being inflicted equally upon them both; yet to the one it is a
          mild punishment when his nobler temperament is taken into
          account, whereas it is a hard punishment to the other in view
          of his baser temperament. But, on the other hand, were they
          all equally condemned to penal servitude for life, the
          honourable man would be too severely punished, while the
          other, on account of his baseness of nature, would be too
          mildly punished. In the judgement to be pronounced over a
          number of criminals united in such a conspiracy, the best
          equalizer of punishment and crime in the form of public
          justice is death. And besides all this, it has never been
          heard of that a criminal condemned to death on account of a
          murder has complained that the sentence inflicted on him more
          than was right and just; and any one would treat him with
          scorn if he expressed himself to this effect against it.
          Otherwise it would be necessary to admit that, although wrong
          and injustice are not done to the criminal by the law, yet the
          legislative power is not entitled to administer this mode of
          punishment; and if it did so, it would be in contradiction
          with itself. </font></p>
      <p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[8] However many
          they may be who have committed a murder, or have even
          commanded it, or acted as art and part in it, they ought all
          to suffer death; for so justice wills it, in accordance with
          the idea of the juridical power, as founded on the universal
          laws of reason. But the number of the accomplices (<span
            style="font-style: italic;">correi</span>) in such a deed
          might happen to be so great that the state, in resolving to be
          without such criminals, would be in danger of soon also being
          deprived of subjects. But it will not thus dissolve itself,
          neither must it return to the much worse condition of nature,
          in which there would be no external justice. Nor, above all,
          should it deaden the sensibilities of the people by the
          spectacle of justice being exhibited in the mere carnage of a
          slaughtering bench. In such circumstances the sovereign must
          always be allowed to have it in his power to take the part of
          the judge upon himself as a case of necessity--and to deliver
          a judgement which, instead of the penalty of death, shall
          assign some other punishment to the criminals and thereby
          preserve a multitude of the people. The penalty of deportation
          is relevant in this connection. Such a form of judgement
          cannot be carried out according to a public law, but only by
          an authoritative act of the royal prerogative, and it may only
          be applied as an act of grace in individual cases. </font></p>
      <p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[9] Against these
          doctrines, the Marquis Beccaria has given forth a different
          view. Moved by the compassionate sentimentality of a humane
          feeling, he has asserted that all capital punishment is wrong
          in itself and unjust. He has put forward this view on the
          ground that the penalty of death could not be contained in the
          original civil contract [i.e., that if we had decided as a
          society what rules we should all live by, we would not have
          agreed to allow the death penalty]; for, in that case, every
          one of the people would have had to consent to lose his life
          if he murdered any of his fellow citizens. But [Beccaria
          argues that] such a consent is impossible, because no one can
          thus dispose of his own life. All this is mere sophistry and
          perversion of right. No one undergoes punishment because he
          has willed to be punished, but because he has willed a
          punishable action; for it is in fact no punishment when any
          one experiences what he wills, and it is impossible for any
          one to will to be punished. To say, "I will to be punished, if
          I murder any one," can mean nothing more than, "I submit
          myself along with all the other citizens to the laws"; and if
          there are any criminals among the people, these laws will
          include penal laws. The individual who, as a co-legislator,
          enacts penal law cannot possibly be the same person who, as a
          subject, is punished according to the law; for, as a criminal,
          he cannot possibly be regarded as having a voice in the
          legislation, the legislator being rationally viewed as just
          and holy. If any one, then, enact a penal law against himself
          as a criminal, it must be the pure juridically law-giving
          reason (<span style="font-style: italic;">homo noumenon</span>),




          which subjects him as one capable of crime, and consequently
          as another person (homo phenomenon), along with all the others
          in the civil union, to this penal law. In other words, it is
          not the people taken distributively, but the tribunal of
          public justice, as distinct from the criminal, that prescribes
          capital punishment; and it is not to be viewed as if the
          social contract contained the promise of all the individuals
          to allow themselves to be punished, thus disposing of
          themselves and their lives. For if the right to punish must be
          grounded upon a promise of the wrongdoer, whereby he is to be
          regarded as being willing to be punished, it ought also to be
          left to him to find himself deserving of the punishment; and
          the criminal would thus be his own judge. The chief error
          (proton pseudos) of this sophistry consists in regarding the
          judgement of the criminal himself, necessarily determined by
          his reason, that he is under obligation to undergo the loss of
          his life, as a judgement that must be grounded on a resolution
          of his will to take it away himself; and thus the execution of
          the right in question is represented as united in one and the
          same person with the adjudication of the right. </font></p>
      <p><font style="font-family: Georgia;" size="-1">[10] There are,
          however, two crimes worthy of death, in respect of which it
          still remains doubtful whether the legislature have the right
          to deal with them capitally. It is the sentiment of honour
          that induces their perpetration. The one originates in a
          regard for womanly honour, the other in a regard for military
          honour; and in both cases there is a genuine feeling of honour
          incumbent on the individuals as a duty. The former is the
          crime of maternal infanticide (<span style="font-style:
            italic;">infanticidium maternale</span>); the latter is the
          crime of killing a fellow-soldier in a duel (<span
            style="font-style: italic;">commilitonicidium</span>). Now
          legislation cannot take away the shame of an illegitimate
          birth, nor wipe off the stain attaching from a suspicion of
          cowardice, to an officer who does not resist an act that would
          bring him into contempt, by an effort of his own that is
          superior to the fear of death. Hence it appears that, in such
          circumstances, the individuals concerned are remitted to the
          state of nature; and their acts in both cases must be called
          homicide, and not murder, which involves evil intent (<span
            style="font-style: italic;">homicidium dolosum</span>). In
          all instances the acts are undoubtedly punishable; but they
          cannot be punished by the supreme power with death. An
          illegitimate child comes into the world outside of the law
          which properly regulates marriage, and it is thus born beyond
          the pale or constitutional protection of the law. Such a child
          is introduced, as it were, like prohibited goods, into the
          commonwealth, and as it has no legal right to existence in
          this way, its destruction might also be ignored; nor can the
          shame of the mother, when her unmarried confinement is known,
          be removed by any legal ordinance. A subordinate officer,
          again, on whom an insult is inflicted, sees himself compelled
          by the public opinion of his associates to obtain
          satisfaction; and, as in the state of nature, the punishment
          of the offender can only be effected by a duel, in which his
          own life is exposed to danger, and not by means of the law in
          a court of justice. The duel is therefore adopted as the means
          of demonstrating his courage as that characteristic upon which
          the honour of his profession essentially rests; and this is
          done even if it should issue in the killing of his adversary.
          But as such a result takes place publicly and under the
          consent of both parties, although it may be done unwillingly,
          it cannot properly be called murder (<span style="font-style:
            italic;">homicidium dolosum</span>). What then is the right
          in both cases as relating to criminal justice? Penal justice
          is here in fact brought into great straits, having apparently
          either to declare the notion of honour, which is certainly no
          mere fancy here, to be nothing in the eye of the law, or to
          exempt the crime from its due punishment; and thus it would
          become either remiss or cruel. The knot thus tied is to be
          resolved in the following way. The categorical imperative of
          penal justice, that the killing of any person contrary to the
          law must be punished with death, remains in force; but the
          legislation itself and the civil constitution generally, so
          long as they are still barbarous and incomplete, are at fault.
          And this is the reason why the subjective motive-principles of
          honour among the people do not coincide with the standards
          which are objectively conformable to another purpose; so that
          the public justice issuing from the state becomes injustice
          relatively to that which is upheld among the people
          themselves. </font><br>

          as well as pederasty or bestiality? The punishment for rape
          and pederasty is castration (like that of a white or black
          eunuch in a seraglio), that for bestiality, permanent
          expulsion from civil society, since the criminal has made
