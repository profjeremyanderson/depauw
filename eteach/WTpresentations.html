          issues as they watch the film, and lead a discussion exploring
          them as deeply as possible after the film. You must
          demonstrate that you&#8217;ve done relevant research and become
          familiar with the film and thought about it all. Doing this
          well requires substantial preparation. More specifically: <br>

            should read it especially carefully, several times, and well

              your film and the philosophical issues in it.</span> This
            is essential even if you think you know your film very well.
            To do this:</font><br>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><span
                style="font-weight: bold;">1. Learn about your film and
                reactions to it. </span>Go to the <a target="_blank"
                href="http://www.imdb.com">Internet Movie Database</a>,
              find your film, and click on the links to learn more about
              it. Check the <span style="font-style: italic;">critics'
              </span>reviews (called "external reviews," <a
                target="_blank"

                by clicking "MORE" on the menus just above the film
                title</a>): under the names of the director and writers,
              there are links to reviews from many publications. Read a
              bunch to find out how others have reacted to the film. If
              Wikipedia has a page on your film, check it out (but don&#8217;t
              believe all you find!). It may have leads to interesting
              articles and books about the issues in your film.<br>

            </font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2.
                Learn more about the philosophical issues in your film.
              </span>In the assigned reading(s) for your film, various
              terms and issues will arise. (For example, in the reading
              for <span style="font-style: italic;">The Truman Show</span>
              we came across &#8220;the Problem of the External World.&#8221;) Find
              out more about those terms and issues. Some discussion of
              them may be found in the material you find via IMDB,
              Wikipedia, etc.; more may be found by consulting a
              dictionary of philosophy (for terms, and brief bios of
              philosophers) and encyclopedias of philosophy (for
              issues). A trove of philosophy links is available via my

          <font style="font-weight: bold;" size="-1">G. After the film,

          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><span
                style="font-weight: bold;">1. You could present, and
                argue for, your take on the film.</span> You may agree
              with the assigned readings or not, but you should make
              some connection between your take and the readings&#8217;. The
              challenge here is being able to explain persuasively why
              the class should agree with you. </font><br>
            <font size="-1"><br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Alternatively, you
                could lead discussion (which is what I tend to do). </span>This

















              is challenging, too, but in a different way: you&#8217;ll need
              to be prepared to lead discussion for a while. Think about
              all the issues in the film, and then decide which are most
              important. Develop questions to ask the class, and think
              about what follow-up questions you might ask to get people
              to think more deeply. Try not to &#8220;lead&#8221; the class into
              giving your answers. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Push











                class members to think more carefully.</span>&nbsp; </font><br>
            <font size="-1"><br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">3. You could do some of
                both of these. Or you could come up with something
                different. </span>It&#8217;s up to you. </font><br>
          </div>
          <font size="-1"><br>
            And of course you can come talk with me about any of this

        </font>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">The above are
            things needed to do a passable job on this assignment. You
            could make it even better. For example, you could isolate a
            clip or two from the film to show afterwards, so that we can
            re-examine it and discuss it. (This might have been good for
            the couch scene between Lester and Angela near the end of <span
              style="font-style: italic;">American Beauty</span>, for
            example, since it highlights important differences between
            them.) Or you could bring in a quick clip from a different
            film for comparison. If you think it&#8217;d help, you could use
            PowerPoint to enhance your presentation. It is often very
            helpful to create a 1-2 page handout briefly summarizing any
            points you want to make.<br>
            <br>
            What makes a presentation excellent, though, isn't just
            doing more things. It's doing things which (a) demonstrate
            that you have done a good deal of careful research and
            thought and (b) raise the intellectual level of discussion
            in the class.&nbsp; <br>

                on Academic Integrity</a> applies to this assignment
              (and all work for the course, actually). </span>It is not
            acceptable to present work done for another course; that's
            getting credit twice for the same work. Nor may you present
            work done for some extracurricular activity, because then
            you're not doing new work for this course. (Having a <span
              style="font-style: italic;">portion </span>of your
            presentation consist of work done elsewhere might be
            acceptable; consult with me beforehand.) You must cite <span

            relied on for <span style="font-style: italic;">any </span>part

















            of your presentation--the ideas, arguments, images, clips, <span
              style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">everything</span>,
            whether you quoted them or paraphrased them or just borrowed
            the inspiration. These citations must be included in the
            required documentation of your work for the presentation,
            and if you do a PowerPoint show, all sources used in it must
            also be listed at the end of the slides, and you must send
            me a copy of the PowerPoint. Failure to meet these
            requirements will automatically and substantially hurt your
            assignment grade, and might be prosecuted for academic
            dishonesty. The minimum penalty for dishonesty is worse than
            not doing the assignment at all, and will almost guarantee a
            failing grade for the course. <br>
