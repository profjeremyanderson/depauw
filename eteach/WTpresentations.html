              we came across &#8220;the Problem of the External World.&#8221;) Find

              them may be found in the material you find via IMDB,
              Wikipedia, etc.; more may be found by consulting a
              dictionary of philosophy (for terms, and brief bios of

                different way: you&#8217;ll need to be prepared to lead
                discussion for a while. Think about all the issues in
                the film, and then decide which are most important.
                Develop questions to ask the class, and think about what
                follow-up questions you might ask to get people to think
                more deeply. Try not to &#8220;lead&#8221; the class into giving
                your answers. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Push

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">The above are
            things needed to do a passable job on this assignment. You
            could make it even better. For example, you could isolate a
            clip or two from the film to show afterwards, so that we can
            re-examine it and discuss it. (This might have been good for
            the couch scene between Lester and Angela near the end of <span
              style="font-style: italic;">American Beauty</span>, for
            example, since it highlights important differences between
            them.) Or you could bring in a quick clip from a different
            film for comparison. If you think it&#8217;d help, you could use
            PowerPoint to enhance your presentation. It is often very
            helpful to create a 1-2 page handout briefly summarizing any
            points you want to make.<br>
            <br>
            What makes a presentation excellent, though, isn't just
            doing more things. It's doing things which show you've done
            a good deal of thinking and research, and raise the
            intellectual level of discussion in the class.&nbsp; <br>

            getting credit twice for the same work. Nor may you present
            work done for some extracurricular activity, because then
            you're not doing new work for this course. (Having a <span

            presentation consist of work done elsewhere might be

            whether you quoted them or paraphrased them or just borrowed
            the inspiration. These citations must be included in the
            required documentation of your work for the presentation,
            and if you do a PowerPoint show, all sources used in it must
            also be listed at the end of the slides, and you must send
            me a copy of the PowerPoint. Failure to meet these
            requirements will automatically and substantially hurt your
            assignment grade, and might be charged as academic
            dishonesty. The minimum penalty for dishonesty is worse than
            not doing the assignment at all, and will almost guarantee a
            failing grade for the course. <br>
