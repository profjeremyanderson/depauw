            <h4><big>Introduction to standard form</big></h4>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Philosophers usually present
              their arguments in prose. It is often helpful to take an
              argument from its original prose statement and lay out its
              premise(s) and conclusion(s) -- i.e., to put it into
              standard form, because then its reasoning (whether good or
              bad!) may be seen more clearly.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              Here's a simple argument in standard form.<br>
              <br>
              <table style=" text-align: left; width: 90%;" border="1"
                cellpadding="15" cellspacing="0">
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <td style=" vertical-align: middle;
                      background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">1. Humans
                      are mortal. <br>
                      2. Socrates is human.<br>
                      3. Therefore, Socrates is mortal (by 1 and 2).</td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
              <br>
              From this, we can see the few simple rules of standard
              form: <br>
            </div>
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
              <li>The argument is written as a list of numbered steps. </li>
              <li>Each step contains only one proposition -- a single
                declarative sentence. That proposition may be a premise,
                a conclusion, or both the conclusion of one argument and
                a premise of another.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Premises come before the conclusions they are supposed
                to support. </li>
              <li>Conclusions are signaled by words like &#8220;Therefore...&#8221;
                or &#8220;So...&#8221; or sometimes three dots in a triangle: .: <br>
              </li>
              <li>We say which premises are supposed to support each
                conclusion.</li>
            </ul>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Also, in work submitted for
              credit, academic integrity is important. (Here are the <a
                target="_blank" href="101papers.html#integrity">academic
                integrity instructions for this course</a> and <a
                target="_blank"

                integrity policy</a>). So, if you are putting an
              argument in standard form for a something you will submit
              for credit, there's one more rule: <br>
            </div>
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
              <li>Cite the argument's source and, if you use an author's
                words, put them within quotation marks.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4><big>First example: a relatively easy case</big><br>
            </h4>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Here is an example of how to
              convert a relatively simple prose argument into standard
              form. <br>
              &nbsp; <br>
              Let&#8217;s take a sample from Andrew Bailey&#8217;s discussion of
              inductive arguments. We will be careful to keep the
              author's words within quotation marks whenever we use
              them: <br>
              <br>
              <table style=" text-align: left; width: 90%;" border="1"
                cellpadding="15" cellspacing="0">
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <td style=" vertical-align: middle;
                      background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&#8220;The
                      biological world is a highly complex and
                      inter-dependent system. It is highly unlikely that
                      such a system would have come about (and would
                      continue to hang together) from the purely random
                      motions of particles. It would be much less
                      surprising if it were the result of conscious
                      design from a super-intelligent creator.
                      Therefore, the biological world was deliberately
                      created (and therefore, God exists)&#8221; (Bailey, xx).
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>

              <br>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">To start, let&#8217;s break this
              text down into a numbered list of separate propositions.
              To do this, we go through Bailey's paragraph and start a
              new line after each claim, and then number the resulting
              list. Some correction of punctuation is needed: <br>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
              <table style=" text-align: left; width: 90%;" border="1"

                      highly complex and inter-dependent system.&#8221; <br>

                      the result of conscious design from a

                      4. &#8220;Therefore, the biological world was
                      deliberately created.&#8221; <br>

              &nbsp; <br>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Notice that we have kept
              Bailey's words in quotation marks and kept the citation.
              These are needed to maintain academic integrity. Also,
              notice how this example follows the other rules of
              standard form:<br>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
              <ul>
                <li>We now have a series of numbered steps.</li>
                <li>Each step contains only one proposition: one premise
                  or one conclusion (with step #4 being both a
                  conclusion and a premise, but it is one proposition so
                  it is placed in one numbered step).</li>
                <li>The premises come before the conclusions they are
                  supposed to support. We didn't have to re-order of the
                  statements because the prose argument was written that
                  way.<br>
                </li>
                <li>The conclusions are signaled (by "therefore").</li>
              </ul>
              But we are not yet finished. Our last task is to indicate
              which premises support each of the conclusions. Here is
              the final version of the argument, which now follows all
              the rules of standard form: <br>
              <br>
              <table style=" text-align: left; width: 90%;" border="1"
                cellpadding="15" cellspacing="0">

                      4. &#8220;Therefore, the biological world was

              Now, we might wonder whether 5 could follow merely from 4,
              rather than both 3 and 4. The mention of
              "super-intelligent" seems to be a feature attributed to
              God that is not apparent from 4 alone, so I think 5 is
              meant to follow from both 3 and 4. <br>
              <br>
              That was fairly easy.<br>
              <br>
            </div>
            <h4><big>Second example: a more challenging case</big><br>
            </h4>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Let&#8217;s take a more
              challenging example from our textbook. This argument is
              about whether "vital spirit" exists -- that is, whether
              there is some spiritual substance in the universe, in
              addition to matter, which makes things alive. The author
              here argues that denying "vital spirit" is self-defeating
              (or "self-refuting"):&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              <table style=" text-align: left; width: 90%;" border="1"
                cellpadding="15" cellspacing="0">
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <td style=" vertical-align: top; background-color:
                      rgb(255, 255, 255);">&#8220;The anti-vitalist says that
                      there is no such thing as vital spirit. But this
                      claim is self-refuting. The speaker can be taken
                      seriously only if his claim cannot. For if the
                      claim is true, then the speaker does not have
                      vital spirit and must be <span style="font-style:
                        italic;">dead</span>. But if he is dead, then
                      his statement is a meaningless string of noises,
                      devoid of reason and truth&#8221; (Bailey, xx-i). </td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
              &nbsp; <br>
              Again, we start by breaking the text into a numbered list
              of propositions. Again, we just go through the text and
              start a new line for each claim, and then number them.
              Some correction and clarification are needed, both to make
              each step a grammatically correct proposition and to
              ensure the meaning of each step stays clear: <br>
              <br>

                      2. &#8220;But this claim [that there is no such thing as
                      vital motion] is self-refuting.&#8221; <br>
                      3. &#8220;The speaker can be taken seriously only if his
                      claim cannot.&#8221; <br>
                      4. &#8220;For if the claim is true, then the speaker
                      does not have vital spirit&#8221; [yes, an if-then
                      statement is generally one step]<br>
                      5. Someone who does not have vital spirit &#8220;must be

                      6. &#8220;But if he is dead, then his statement is a
                      meaningless string of noises, devoid of reason and
                      truth&#8221; (Bailey, xx-i). </td>

              &nbsp; <br>
              That last step, #6, is tricky. Notice that two sorts of
              accusations are being made about the anti-vitalist's
              statement: (a) that it "is a meaningless string of noises"
              and (b) that it is "devoid of reason and truth." These two
              accusations are separated by a comma, which leaves it
              unclear how (a) and (b) are supposed to relate to each
              other. Perhaps (b) is meant to be a mere restatement of
              (a), so that step #6 could read like this:<br>
              <br>
              <table style=" text-align: left; width: 90%;" border="1"
                cellpadding="15" cellspacing="0">
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <td style=" vertical-align: top; background-color:
                      rgb(255, 255, 255);">6'. "But if he is dead, then
                      his statement is a meaningless string of noises";
                      in other words, it is "devoid of reason and
                      truth." </td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
              <br>
              Or is (b) perhaps a <span style="font-style: italic;">consequence


              </span>of (a)? In other words, maybe the author is saying
              that the anti-vitalist's statement is "devoid of reason
              and truth" <span style="font-style: italic;">because </span>it






              is "a meaningless string of noises." If so, (a) and (b)
              make an argument, with (a) as the premise for conclusion
              (b). Then the rules of standard form would require us to
              restate #6 in two parts, maybe like this:<br>
              <br>
              <table style=" text-align: left; width: 90%;" border="1"
                cellpadding="15" cellspacing="0">
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <td style=" vertical-align: top; background-color:
                      rgb(255, 255, 255);">6''. "But if he is dead, then
                      his statement is a meaningless string of noises."<br>
                      7. Therefore, his statement is "devoid of reason
                      and truth" (by 6'').&nbsp; </td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
              <br>
              What should we do here? Should we stay with the original,
              #6, or use 6', or use 6'' plus 7? Here is my suggestion:
              if we use either 6' or 6'' plus 7, we risk putting words
              into the author's mouth which the author did not intend.
              But if we stay with the original 6 we do not risk such
              misinterpretation. Also, if we stay with 6 the argument
              seems clear enough; we do not need to figure out what that
              comma means in order to understand the argument. Moreover,
              we can evaluate the argument without knowing which of
              these the author meant. So I would stay with the original,
              6. <br>
              <br>
              However, before we are finished we need to re-order the
              statements to put the conclusions after their premises.
              Notice that steps 4, 5, and 6 are premises, but no
              conclusions appear after them. (This is especially obvious
              with 4 and 6, which start with &#8220;For&#8221; and &#8220;But&#8221;: these
              words signal that those statements are premises.) So the
              conclusions that 4, 5, and 6 are supposed to support must
              be above. Let's rearrange the propositions into logical
              order, with premises prior to conclusions and conclusions
              indicating which premises support them. We correct the
              statements&#8217; grammar where needed, and here is the finished
              version: <br>
              <br>

                      vital spirit] is true, then the speaker does not
