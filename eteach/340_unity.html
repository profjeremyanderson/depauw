                </font></div>
              <font style="font-family: Georgia;" size="-1"><br>
                If the commonwealth is a person writ large and civil war
                is its death, then we might regard those things that
                weaken it and may kill it as diseases, poisons, and so
                on. (Hobbes describes them that way in chapter 29.)
                Here, however, we will note how the "artificial man" is
                made strong. <br>
                <br>
                Hobbes argues that people in a state of nature may form
                groups for defense against a common enemy. But such
                groups are unstable because of people's inherent
                tendencies to disagree with and envy each other. They
                are vulnerable to discord from internal dissent and
                contention for power (L 17.4-11; cf. L 6.6). Therefore,
                Hobbes says, people must subject themselves to a &#8220;common
                power,&#8221; in a particular way he describes in chapter 17:<br>
                <br>
              </font>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Georgia;"><font
                  size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
                  only way to erect such a common power, as may be able
                  to defend them from the invasion of foreigners, and
                  the injuries of one another...is, to confer all their
                  power and strength upon one man, or upon one assembly
                  of men, that may reduce all their wills, by plurality
                  of voices, unto one will: which is as much as to say,
                  to appoint one man, or assembly of men, to bear their
                  person; and every one to own, and acknowledge himself
                  to be author of whatsoever he that so beareth their
                  person, shall act, or cause to be acted, in those
                  things which concern the common peace and safety; and
                  therein to submit their wills, every one to his will,
                  and their judgments, to his judgment. This is more
                  than consent, or concord; it is a real unity of them
                  all, in one and the same person, made by covenant of
                  every man with every man, in such manner, as if every
                  man should say to every man, <span style="font-style:
                    italic;">I authorise and give up my right of
                    governing myself, to this man, or to this assembly
                    of men, on this condition, that thou give up thy
                    right to him, and authorize all his actions in like
                    manner</span>. This done, the multitude so united in
                  one person, is called a COMMONWEALTH, in Latin
                  CIVITAS. This is the generation of that great
                  LEVIATHAN, or rather (to speak more reverently) of
                  that <span style="font-style: italic;">mortal god</span>,
                  to which we owe under the <span style="font-style:
                    italic;">immortal God</span>, our peace and defence.
                  (L 17.13; Hobbes's emphasis)<br>
                </font></div>
              <font style="font-family: Georgia;" size="-1"><br>
                I quote this passage at length so that we may clearly
                see two things. First, Hobbes says the process he is
                about to describe is the <span style="font-style:
                  italic;">only </span>way to find safety from hostile
                outsiders and from each other. <br>
                <br>
                Second, notice the repetition and elaboration throughout
                the middle of the paragraph. Hobbes emphasizes setting
                aside our own individual judgments and accepting instead
                the sovereign&#8217;s judgment &#8220;in those things which concern
                the common peace and safety,&#8221; so much so that the
                sovereign&#8217;s actions are said to be <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">authorized </span>by us
                all. This creates a &#8220;multitude...united in one person&#8221;
                which is the source of &#8220;our peace and defence.&#8221;<br>
                <br>
                Hobbes&#8217;s notion of authorization is demanding, and so
                important that Leviathan&#8217;s chapter 16 is devoted to
                explaining it. If I authorize the sovereign and the
                sovereign punishes me for some crime, Hobbes believes I
                have authorized my own punishment (L 18.3), even if I
                try to deny it. When we all authorize the sovereign, the
                sovereign&#8217;s judgments are to be taken as ours; her (or
                his or their) governance replaces our individual
                governance of ourselves to the extent needed for &#8220;the
                common peace and safety.&#8221; <br>
                <br>
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;"> Hobbes carefully
                  contrasts authorization here from mere &#8220;consent, or
                  concord&#8221;: "</span></font><font style="font-family:
                Georgia;" size="-1">This is more than consent, or
                concord; it is a real unity of them all, in one and the
                same person." </font><font style="font-family:
                Georgia;" size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Consent

                  is fragile: we </span><span style="font-style:
                  italic; font-family: Georgia;">consent </span><span
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">with each other when
                  each of us separately decides to do something&#8212;say,
                  carpool to work. But in merely consenting, each of us
                  retains our right to act according to our own
                  judgments. Because of this, our concord will disappear
                  as soon as one of us decides for whatever reason to
                  break it--say, you dislike my car's color. <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">Unity</span>, however,
                  is (or is supposed to be) strong: the &#8220;real unity&#8221;
                  created by authorizing the sovereign can't be revoked
                  except in extreme circumstances, which Hobbes
                  discusses in chapter 21.* </span><br>
                <br>
                This sort of unity, where one accepts someone else's
                judgments, may seem weird and magical. How could you
                possibly give up your judgment to someone else? But we
                can find real-life examples of people doing just that
                every day. One example is accepting courts' rulings.
                Suppose two drivers collide and disagree about who is to
                blame for the damage to their cars. Each believes the
                other deserves all the blame. Suppose their dispute goes
                to a court of law, and the court rules that each is
                partly to blame--i.e., the court's ruling does not match
                either driver's individual judgment. But the drivers
                must accept the court's ruling as authoritative. Well,
                wait, you might say; can't they appeal the court's
                ruling? Yes, but eventually they will reach some court
                which has the final say. When the drivers accept that
                ruling, each accepts the judgment of another--the
                court--in place of their own. Further, due to the
                court's position of authority in society, the drivers
                may not simply change their minds about whether to
                respect the ruling. Hobbes's notion of real unity
                expands this acceptance of another's judgment to cover
                accepting the sovereign's judgments in all matters of
                common peace and safety. <br>
                <br>
                Of course it is possible that one or both drivers still
                disagrees with the court. They may want try to force
                each other to pay. Left to themselves, their dispute may
                become violent. In a stable society this would be the
                exception, but it could happen, and it could be a
                problem. Hobbes's solution is to rely on the loyalty of
                other citizens who serve as police: their combined power
                can, if needed, intimidate the drivers into behaving
                themselves or, if they break the law, may fine or
                imprison them as an example to others. As Hobbes
                continues: <br>

                  size="-1">For by this authority, given him by every
                  particular man in the commonwealth, [the sovereign]
                  hath the use of so much power and strength conferred
                  on him, that by terror thereof, he is enabled to form
                  the wills of them all, to peace at home, and mutual
                  aid against their enemies abroad. And in him
                  consisteth the essence of the commonwealth; which (to
                  define it,) is <span style="font-style: italic;">one
                    person, of whose acts a great multitude, by mutual
                    covenants one with another, have made themselves
                    every one the author, to the end he may use the
                    strength and means of them all, as he shall think
                    expedient, for their peace and common defence</span>.
                  (L 17.13)<br>

              <font style="font-family: Georgia;" size="-1"><br>
                The authority conferred on the sovereign gives her (or
                him or them) power. It is what makes the sovereign
                radically superior to the citizen. This power guides the
                subjects&#8217; wills in whatever direction the sovereign
                deems necessary for peace and preservation. Being backed
                by threats of punishment is how the sovereign&#8217;s command
                becomes &#8220;the reason we have of doing the action
                commanded.&#8221; <br>
                <br>
                This contrast between consent and unity is not new to <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">Leviathan</span>. Hobbes
                uses it in his earlier accounts of erecting the
                sovereign in <span style="font-style: italic;">The
                  Elements of Law </span>(1640) and <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">De Cive </span>(1642)
                (see EL 19.6-7 and DCv 5.6-8). As I explain at length
                elsewhere, Hobbes's discussions of disorder become
                increasingly reticent about identifying the necessary
                preconditions for rebellion. But in his discussions of
                the commonwealth&#8217;s "birth," Hobbes is firmly committed
                to the necessity of this union. </font><br

              <font style="font-family: Georgia;" size="-1">* Close
                readers may notice </font><font style="font-family:
                Georgia;" size="-1">that Hobbes is not always careful to
                distinguish consent (in the sense of deciding to go
                along with others but retaining the right of private
                judgment) from &#8220;real unity&#8221; (which is formed by many
                people consenting to yield their right of private
                judgment to another). For example, he uses &#8220;consent&#8221; to
                describe how the sovereign judge of right and wrong is
                set up at L 6.7; and in L 10.3 he says, &#8220;The greatest of
                human powers, is that which is compounded of the powers
                of most men, united by consent, in one person,&#8221; clearly
                referring to the sovereign. Similar uses of &#8220;consent&#8221;
                appear at L 15.8, 16.13, 18.2, and elsewhere, and we
                have already seen Hobbes say that the commonwealth&#8217;s
                health consists of &#8220;concord&#8221; in L Intro.1 above. Because
                he is so careful to distinguish the two meanings in EL
                19.6, DCv 5.6, and L 17.13, which are his most detailed
                descriptions of how the sovereign is created, I take
                these other instances of &#8220;consent&#8221; and &#8220;concord&#8221; to be
                shorthand for the special sort of consent that creates
                &#8220;real unity,&#8221; i.e., as signifying consent to give up
                (among other things) the right of private judgment
                rather than consent merely to act together for a while.
