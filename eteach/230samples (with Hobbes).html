                Nothing in this answer is false, but it's still not very
                good. It contains less information than is in the book
                (Pojman, 19), and much less than was on the board and
                discussed in class. It shows very little understanding.

                          skepticism and subjectivism are two different
                          views about the basis of moral rules--that is,
                          about how moral rules get their validity, if
                          any.<br>
                          <br>
                          Moral skepticism admits that there are moral
                          rules, but it holds they have no basis, or
                          none we can know for sure. So, skepticism does
                          not consider any moral principles to be
                          binding (or "valid" as the book says). Moral
                          skepticism implies that ethics is a kind of
                          sham to the extent that it tries to convince
                          us that rules are justified.<br>

                          that moral rules can be justified. But
                          subjectivism says their justification depends
                          entirely on one's personal decision or belief.
                          In other words, subjectivism holds that for an
                          act is right only if you think it is;
                          otherwise it is not. <br>

                This shows a clear understanding that both moral

                Here's a challenging question: <span

                  explained why Hobbes thinks there would be no natural

                  don't need to explain that; just assume it's so.)
                  Explain why Hobbes thinks this competition would
                  result in severe misery (Hobbes, 71). In other words,
                  how does Hobbes argue that we would probably not
                  cooperate with each other but instead end up attacking
                  each other (Hobbes, 70-1)?"</span><br>
                <br>
                This question asks you to explain a fairly complicated

                          we are vain, and that we are translucent. So
                          there would be a war of all against all, and

                        rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font size="-1">Hobbes
                          points out that we are not all the same. Some
                          of us "would be glad to be at ease within
                          modest bounds" (70), that is, they would only
                          use the resources they need and thereby
                          minimize conflicts with others. Let's call
                          those people "nice." But Hobbes says that some
                          people enjoy conquering others and taking more
                          than they need (70). In class we called them
                          "glory seekers."<br>
                          <br>
                          So, what happens when nice people meet glory
                          seekers? In the state of nature, there are no
                          laws nor police to enforce them. So Hobbes
                          says there we have the "right of nature," that
                          is, the right to act however we please (72).
                          So in any situation, it's up to each person to
                          decide how to respond. So when nice people
                          meet glory seekers, the glory seekers will
                          attack, because that's what they like to do
                          and there's nothing to stop them. <br>
                          <br>
                          If the nice people don't defend themselves,
                          they're conquered. If they defend themselves,
                          but ONLY defend themselves and never get
                          aggressive or invade others, Hobbes says they
                          will be defeated in the long run (70). So--if
                          we assume, as Hobbes does, that even nice
                          people want to survive--the nice people cannot
                          just defend themselves but will also have to
                          attack and invade. <br>
                          <br>
                          To make things worse, Hobbes points out
                          (outside the assigned reading) that we are
                          "translucent." That is, you can't tell who is
                          a glory seeker and who is nice just by looking
                          at them. So you always have to be suspicious
                          of everyone: <span style="font-style:
                            italic;">you </span>might be a nice person
                          who's willing to cooperate with other nice
                          people, but it's hard to trust anyone else. <br>
                          <br>
                          In other words, the presence of glory seekers,
                          and our translucence, forces even nice people
                          to behave like glory seekers: they are
                          motivated to attack others both because they
                          will be conquered if they don't, and because
                          they cannot tell who their enemies are. Hobbes
                          says that in this situation the best way to
                          respond is "anticipation," that is, to
                          pre-emptively attack others.<br>
                          <br>
                          So here we already have a situation where
                          people are attacking each other: glory seekers
                          attack nice people and other glory seekers
                          because they <span style="font-style:
                            italic;">want </span>to, and nice people
                          attack glory seekers and other nice people
                          because they <span style="font-style:
                            italic;">have </span>to. <br>
                          <br>
                          But there's more. Hobbes points out that we
                          have a hard time getting along with others
                          because we are vain. Each of us feels entitled
                          to a certain level of respect from others, and
                          when we don't get it, we're motivated to take
                          vengeance on those who (we feel) disrespect
                          us. Again, because of the right of nature,
                          there's nothing preventing us from being as
                          vengeful as we please, so Hobbes thinks we may
                          go as far as killing each other (70). <br>
                          <br>
                          Hobbes says this vanity arises everywhere
                          there's no government to enforce laws (70), so
                          we all have it, not just the glory seekers. So
                          even nice people have a hard time getting
                          along with each other, even when they know
                          they are among nice people. <br>
                          <br>
                          Given all these things (glory seekers, the
                          failure of pure defense, the right of nature,
                          translucence, vanity, and our interest in
                          survival) Hobbes thinks we would pretty much
                          all be fighting each other rather than
                          cooperating. <br>
                          <br>
                          Which is ironic: we would all be pursuing our
                          self interest, but doing it without restraint
                          leads to us all being miserable. </font><font
