    <h3 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A Series of
      Eyes</h3>
    <p>[1] How do we see? In the 19th century the anatomy of the eye was
      known in great detail and the sophisticated mechanisms it employs
      to deliver an accurate picture of the outside world astounded
      everyone who was familiar with them. Scientists of the 19th
      century correctly observed that if a person were so unfortunate as
      to be missing one of the eye's many integrated features, such as
      the lens, or iris, or ocular muscles, the inevitable result would
      be a severe loss of vision or outright blindness. Thus it was
      concluded that the eye could only function if it were nearly
      intact.</p>
    <p>[2] As Charles Darwin was considering possible objections to his
      theory of evolution by natural selection in <em>The Origin of
        Species</em> he discussed the problem of the eye in a section of
      the book appropriately entitled "Organs of Extreme Perfection and
      Complication." He realized that if in one generation an organ of
      the complexity of the eye suddenly appeared, the event would be
      tantamount to a miracle. Somehow, for Darwinian evolution to be
      believable, the difficulty that the public had in envisioning the
      gradual formation of complex organs had to be removed.</p>
    <p>[3] Darwin succeeded brilliantly, not by actually describing a
      real pathway that evolution might have used in constructing the
      eye, but rather by pointing to a variety of animals that were
      known to have eyes of various constructions, ranging from a simple
      light sensitive spot to the complex vertebrate camera eye, and
      suggesting that the evolution of the human eye might have involved
      similar organs as intermediates.</p>
    <p>[4] But the question remains, how do we see? Although Darwin was
      able to persuade much of the world that a modern eye could be
      produced gradually from a much simpler structure, he did not even
      attempt to explain how the simple light sensitive spot that was
      his starting point actually worked. When discussing the eye Darwin
      dismissed the question of its ultimate mechanism<a href="#1">1</a><a
        name="note1" id="note1"></a>:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="blockquote">How a nerve comes
      to be sensitive to light hardly concerns us more than how life
      itself originated.</p>
    <p>He had an excellent reason for declining to answer the question:
      19th century science had not progressed to the point where the
      matter could even be approached. The question of how the eye
      works--that is, what happens when a photon of light first impinges
      on the retina--simply could not be answered at that time. As a
      matter of fact, no question about the underlying mechanism of life
      could be answered at that time. How do animal muscles cause
      movement? How does photosynthesis work? How is energy extracted
      from food? How does the body fight infection? Nobody knew.</p>
    <h3 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Calvinism</h3>
    <p>[5] Now, it appears to be a characteristic of the human mind that
      when it is unconstrained by knowledge of the mechanisms of a
      process, then it seems easy to imagine simple steps leading from
      non-function to function. A happy example of this is seen in the
      popular comic strip Calvin and Hobbes. Little boy Calvin is always
      having adventures in the company of his tiger Hobbes by jumping in
      a box and traveling back in time, or grabbing a toy ray gun and
      "transmogrifying" himself into various animal shapes, or again
      using a box as a duplicator and making copies of himself to deal
      with worldly powers such as his mom and his teachers. A small
      child such as Calvin finds it easy to imagine that a box just
      might be able to fly like an airplane (or something), because
      Calvin does not know how airplanes work.</p>
    <p>[6] A good example from the biological world of complex changes
      appearing to be simple is the belief in spontaneous generation.
      One of the chief proponents of the theory of spontaneous
      generation during the middle of the 19th century was Ernst
      Haeckel, a great admirer of Darwin and an eager popularizer of
      Darwin's theory. From the limited view of cells that 19th century
      microscopes provided, Haeckel believed that a cell was a "simple
      little lump of albuminous combination of carbon," <a href="#2">2</a><a
        name="note2" id="note2"></a> not much different from a piece of
      microscopic Jello. Thus it seemed to Haeckel that such simple life
      could easily be produced from inanimate material. In 1859, the
      year of the publication of <em>The Origin of Species,</em> an
      exploratory vessel, H.M.S. Cyclops, dredged up some curious
      looking mud from the sea bottom. Eventually Haeckel came to
      observe the mud and thought that it closely resembled some cells
      he had seen under a microscope. Excitedly he brought this to the
      attention of Thomas Henry Huxley, Darwin's great friend and
      defender. Huxley, too, became convinced that it was <em>Urschleim</em>
      (that is, protoplasm), the progenitor of life itself, and Huxley
      named the mud <em>Bathybius Haeckelii</em> after the eminent
      proponent of abiogenesis.</p>
    <p>[7] The mud failed to grow. In later years, with the development
      of new biochemical techniques and improved microscopes, the
      complexity of the cell was revealed. The "simple lumps" were shown
      to contain thousands of different types of organic molecules,
      proteins, and nucleic acids, many discrete subcellular structures,
      specialized compartments for specialized processes, and an
      extremely complicated architecture. Looking back from the
      perspective of our time, the episode of Bathybius Haeckelii seems
      silly or downright embarrassing, but it shouldn't. Haeckel and
      Huxley were behaving naturally, like Calvin: since they were
      unaware of the complexity of cells, they found it easy to believe
      that cells could originate from simple mud.</p>
    <p>[8] Throughout history there have been many other examples,
      similar to that of Haeckel, Huxley and the cell, where a key piece
      of a particular scientific puzzle was beyond the understanding of
      the age. In science there is even a whimsical term for a machine
      or structure or process that does something, but the actual
      mechanism by which it accomplishes its task is unknown: it is
      called a 'black box.' In Darwin's time all of biology was a black
      box: not only the cell, or the eye, or digestion, or immunity, but
      every biological structure and function because, ultimately, no
      one could explain how biological processes occurred.</p>
    <p>[9] Ernst Mayr, the prominent biologist, historian, and guiding
      force behind the neo-Darwinian synthesis, has pointed out that <a
        href="#3">3</a><a name="note3" id="note3"></a>:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="blockquote">Any scientific
      revolution has to accept all sorts of black boxes, for if one had
      to wait until all black boxes are opened, one would never have any
      conceptual advances.</p>
    <p>That is true. But in earlier days when black boxes were finally
      opened science, and sometimes the whole world, appeared to change.
      Biology has progressed tremendously due to the model that Darwin
      put forth. But the black boxes Darwin accepted are now being
      opened, and our view of the world is again being shaken.</p>
    <h3 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Proteins</h3>
    <p>[10] In order to understand the molecular basis of life it is
      necessary to understand how things called "proteins" work.
      Although most people think of protein" as something you eat, one
      of the major food groups, when they reside in the body of an
      uneaten animal or plant proteins serve a different purpose.
      Proteins are the machinery of living tissue that builds the
      structures and carries out the chemical reactions necessary for
      life. For example, the first of many steps necessary for the
      conversion of sugar to biologically-usable forms of energy is
      carried out by a protein called hexokinase. Skin is made in large
      measure of a protein called collagen. When light impinges on your
      retina it interacts first with a protein called rhodopsin. As can
      be seen even by this limited number of examples proteins carry out
      amazingly diverse functions. However, in general a given protein
      can perform only one or a few functions: rhodopsin cannot form
      skin and collagen cannot interact usefully with light. Therefore a
      typical cell contains thousands and thousands of different types
      of proteins to perform the many tasks necessary for life, much
      like a carpenter's workshop might contain many different kinds of
      tools for various carpentry work.</p>
    <p>[11] What do these versatile tools look like? The basic structure
      of proteins is quite simple: they are formed by hooking together
      in a chain discrete subunits called amino acids. Although the
      protein chain can consist of anywhere from about 50 to about 1,000
      amino acid links, each position can only contain one of twenty
      different amino acids. In this way they are much like words: words
      can come in various lengths but they are made up from a discrete
      set of 26 letters. Now, a protein in a cell does not float around
      like a floppy chain; rather, it folds up into a very precise
      structure which can be quite different for different types of
      proteins. When all is said and done two different amino
      sequences--two different proteins--can be folded to structures as
      specific as and different from each other as a three-eighths inch
      wrench and a jigsaw. And like the household tools, if the shape of
      the proteins is significantly warped then they fail to do their
      jobs.</p>
    <h3 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The Eyesight of
      Man</h3>
    <p>[12] In general, biological processes on the molecular level are
      performed by networks of proteins, each member of which carries
      out a particular task in a chain.</p>
    <p>[13] Let us return to the question, how do we see? Although to
      Darwin the primary event of vision was a black box, through the
      efforts of many biochemists an answer to the question of sight is
      at hand. <a href="#4">4</a><a name="note4" id="note4"></a> When
      light strikes the retina a photon is absorbed by an organic
      molecule called 11-<em>cis</em>-retinal, causing it to rearrange
      within picoseconds to <em>trans</em>-retinal. The change in shape
      of retinal forces a corresponding change in shape of the protein,
      rhodopsin, to which it is tightly bound. As a consequence of the
      protein's metamorphosis, the behavior of the protein changes in a
      very specific way. The altered protein can now interact with
      another protein called transducin. Before associating with
      rhodopsin, transducin is tightly bound to a small organic molecule
      called GDP, but when it binds to rhodopsin the GDP dissociates
      itself from transducin and a molecule called GTP, which is closely
      related to, but critically different from, GDP, binds to
      transducin.</p>
    <p>[14] The exchange of GTP for GDP in the transducinrhodopsin
      complex alters its behavior. GTP-transducinrhodopsin binds to a
      protein called phosphodiesterase, located in the inner membrane of
      the cell. When bound by rhodopsin and its entourage, the
      phosphodiesterase acquires the ability to chemically cleave a
      molecule called cGMP. Initially there are a lot of cGMP molecules
      in the cell, but the action of the phosphodiesterase lowers the
      concentration of cGMP. Activating the phosphodiesterase can be
      likened to pulling the plug in a bathtub, lowering the level of
      water.</p>
    <p>[15] A second membrane protein which binds cGMP, called an ion
      channel, can be thought of as a special gateway regulating the
      number of sodium ions in the cell. The ion channel normally allows
      sodium ions to flow into the cell, while a separate protein
      actively pumps them out again. The dual action of the ion channel
      and pump proteins keeps the level of sodium ions in the cell
      within a narrow range. When the concentration of cGMP is reduced
      from its normal value through cleavage by the phosphodiesterase,
      many channels close, resulting in a reduced cellular concentration
      of positively charged sodium ions. This causes an imbalance of
      charges across the cell membrane which, finally, causes a current
      to be transmitted down the optic nerve to the brain: the result,
      when interpreted by the brain, is vision.</p>
    <p>[16] If the biochemistry of vision were limited to the reactions
      listed above, the cell would quickly deplete its supply of 11-<em>cis</em>-retinal
and



      cGMP while also becoming depleted of sodium ions. Thus a system is
      required to limit the signal that is generated and restore the
      cell to its original state; there are several mechanisms which do
      this. Normally, in the dark, the ion channel, in addition to
      sodium ions, also allows calcium ions to enter the cell; calcium
      is pumped back out by a different protein in order to maintain a
      constant intracellular calcium concentration. However, when cGMP
      levels fall, shutting down the ion channel and decreasing the
      sodium ion concentration, calcium ion concentration is also
      decreased. The phosphodiesterase enzyme, which destroys cGMP, is
      greatly slowed down at lower calcium concentration. Additionally,
      a protein called guanylate cyclase begins to resynthesize cGMP
      when calcium levels start to fall. Meanwhile, while all of this is
      going on, metarhodopsin II is chemically modified by an enzyme
      called rhodopsin kinase, which places a phosphate group on its
      substrate. The modified rhodopsin is then bound by a protein
      dubbed arrestin, which prevents the rhodopsin from further
      activating transducin. Thus the cell contains mechanisms to limit
      the amplified signal started by a single photon.<br>
    </p>
    <p>[17] <em>Trans</em>-retinal eventually falls off of the
      rhodopsin molecule and must be reconverted to 11-<em>cis</em>-retinal


      and again bound by opsin to regenerate rhodopsin for another
      visual cycle. To accomplish this <em>trans</em>-retinal is first
      chemically modified by an enzyme to transretinol, a form
      containing two more hydrogen atoms. A second enzyme then
      isomerizes the molecule to 11-<em>cis</em>-retinol. Finally, a
      third enzyme removes the previouslyadded hydrogen atoms to form
      11-<em>cis</em>-retinal, and the cycle is complete.</p>
    <h3 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">To Explain Life</h3>
    <p>[18] Although many details of the biochemistry of vision have not
      been cited here, the overview just seen is meant to demonstrate
      that, ultimately, <em>this is</em> what it means to 'explain'
      vision. This is the level of explanation that Biological science
      eventually must aim for. In order to say that some function is
      understood, every relevant step in the process must be elucidated.
      The relevant steps in biological processes occur ultimately at the
      molecular level, so a satisfactory explanation of a biological
      phenomenon such as sight, or digestion, or immunity, must include
      a molecular explanation. It is no longer sufficient, now that the
      black box of vision has been opened, for an 'evolutionary
      explanation' of that power to invoke only the anatomical
      structures of whole eyes, as Darwin did in the 19th century and as
      most popularizers of evolution continue to do today. Anatomy is,
      quite simply, irrelevant. So is the fossil record. It does not
      matter whether or not the fossil record is consistent with
      evolutionary theory, any more than it mattered in physics that
      Newton's theory was consistent with everyday experience. The
      fossil record has nothing to tell us about, say, whether or how
      the interactions of 11-<em>cis</em>-retinal with rhodopsin,
      transducin, and phosphodiesterase could have developed
      step-by-step. Neither do the patterns of biogeography matter, or
      of population genetics, or the explanations that evolutionary
      theory has given for rudimentary organs or species abundance.</p>
    <p>[19] "How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light hardly concerns
      us more than how life itself originated," said Darwin in the 19th
      century. But both phenomena have attracted the interest of modern
      biochemistry. The story of the slow paralysis of research on
      life's origin is quite interesting, but space precludes its
      retelling here. Suffice it to say that at present the field of
      origin-of-life studies has dissolved into a cacophony of
      conflicting models, each unconvincing, seriously incomplete, and
      incompatible with competing models. In private even most
      evolutionary biologists will admit that science has no explanation
      for the beginning of life. <a href="#5">5</a><a name="note5"
        id="note5"></a></p>
    <p>[20] The purpose of this paper is to show that the same problems
      which beset origin-of-life research also bedevil efforts to show
      how virtually any complex biochemical system came about.
      Biochemistry has revealed a molecular world which stoutly resists
      explanation by the same theory that has long been applied at the
      level of the whole organism. Neither of Darwin's black boxes--the
      origin of life or the origin of vision or other complex
      biochemical systems--has been accounted for by his theory.</p>
    <h3 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Irreducible
      Complexity</h3>
    <p>[21] In <em>The Origin of Species</em> Darwin stated <a
        href="#6">6</a><a name="note6" id="note6"></a>:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="blockquote">If it could be
      demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not
      possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight
      modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.</p>
    <p>A system which meets Darwin's criterion is one which exhibits<em>
        irreducible complexity.</em> By irreducible complexity I mean a
      single system which is composed of several interacting parts that
      contribute to the basic function, and where the removal of any one
      of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning.
      An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced gradually by
      slight, successive modifications of a precursor system, since any
      precursor to an irreducibly complex system is by definition
      nonfunctional. Since natural selection requires a function to
      select, an irreducibly complex biological system, if there is such
      a thing, would have to arise as an integrated unit for natural
      selection to have anything to act on. It is almost universally
      conceded that such a sudden event would be irreconcilable with the
      gradualism Darwin envisioned. At this point, however, 'irreducibly
      complex' is just a term, whose power resides mostly in its
      definition. We must now ask if any real thing is in fact
      irreducibly complex, and, if so, then are any irreducibly complex
      things also biological systems.</p>
    <p>[22] Consider the humble mousetrap (Figure 1). The mousetraps
      that my family uses in our home to deal with unwelcome rodents
      consist of a number of parts. There are: (1) a flat wooden
      platform to act as a base; (2) a metal hammer, which does the
      actual job of crushing the little mouse; (3) a wire spring with
      extended ends to press against the platform and the hammer when
      the trap is charged; (4) a sensitive catch which releases when
      slight pressure is applied; and (5) a metal bar which holds the
      hammer back when the trap is charged and connects to the catch.
      There are also assorted staples and screws to hold the system
      together.</p>

    <p>[23] If any one of the components of the mousetrap (the base,
      hammer, spring, catch, or holding bar) is removed, then the trap
      does not function. In other words, the simple little mousetrap has
      no ability to trap a mouse until several separate parts are all
      assembled.</p>
    <p>[24] Because the mousetrap is necessarily composed of several
      parts, it is irreducibly complex. Thus, irreducibly complex
      systems exist.</p>
    <h3 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Molecular
      Machines</h3>
    <p>[25] Now, are any biochemical systems irreducibly complex? Yes,
      it turns out that many are.</p>
    <p>[26] Earlier we discussed proteins. In many biological structures
      proteins are simply components of larger molecular machines. Like
      the picture tube, wires, metal bolts and screws that comprise a
      television set, many proteins are part of structures that only
      function when virtually all of the components have been assembled.
      A good example of this is a cilium. <a href="#7">7</a></p>

    <p style="font-style: italic;" class="miscnote"><font size="-1"><strong>Figure

          2a.</strong><em> Animation of a Cilium</em></font> </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>[27] Cilia are hairlike organelles on the surfaces of many animal
      and lower plant cells that serve to move fluid over the cell's
      surface or to "row" single cells through a fluid. In humans, for
      example, epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract each have
      about 200 cilia that beat in synchrony to sweep mucus towards the
      throat for elimination. A cilium consists of a membrane-coated
      bundle of fibers called an axoneme. An axoneme contains a ring of
      9 double microtubules surrounding two central single microtubules.
      Each outer doublet consists of a ring of 13 filaments (subfiber A)
      fused to an assembly of 10 filaments (subfiber B). The filaments
      of the microtubules are composed of two proteins called alpha and
      beta tubulin. The 11 microtubules forming an axoneme are held
      together by three types of connectors: subfibers A are joined to
      the central microtubules by radial spokes; adjacent outer doublets
      are joined by linkers that consist of a highly elastic protein
      called nexin; and the central microtubules are joined by a
      connecting bridge. Finally, every subfiber A bears two arms, an
      inner arm and an outer arm, both containing the protein dynein.</p>
    <p>[28] But how does a cilium work? Experiments have indicated that
      ciliary motion results from the chemically-powered "walking" of
      the dynein arms on one microtubule up the neighboring subfiber B
      of a second microtubule so that the two microtubules slide past
      each other (Figure 2a and b). However, the protein cross-links
      between microtubules in an intact cilium prevent neighboring
      microtubules from sliding past each other by more than a short
      distance. These cross-links, therefore, convert the dynein-induced
      sliding motion to a bending motion of the entire axoneme. </p>

          2b. </strong>Schematic drawing of part of a cilium. The power
        stroke of the motor protein, dynein, attached to one
        microtubule, against subfiber B of a neighboring microtubule
        causes the fibers to slide past each other. The flexible linker
        protein, nexin, converts the sliding motion to a bending motion.
      </font></p>
    <p>[29] Now, let us sit back, review the workings of the cilium, and
      consider what it implies. Cilia are composed of at least a half
      dozen proteins: alpha-tubulin, beta-tubulin, dynein, nexin, spoke
      protein, and a central bridge protein. These combine to perform
      one task, ciliary motion, and all of these proteins must be
      present for the cilium to function. If the tubulins are absent,
      then there are no filaments to slide; if the dynein is missing,
      then the cilium remains rigid and motionless; if nexin or the
      other connecting proteins are missing, then the axoneme falls
      apart when the filaments slide.</p>
    <p>[30] What we see in the cilium, then, is not just profound
      complexity, but also irreducible complexity on the molecular
      scale. Recall that by "irreducible complexity" we mean an
      apparatus that requires several distinct components for the whole
      to work. My mousetrap <strong>must</strong> have a base, hammer,
      spring, catch, and holding bar, all working together, in order to
      function. Similarly, the cilium, as it is constituted, <strong>must</strong>
      have the sliding filaments, connecting proteins, and motor
      proteins for function to occur. In the absence of any one of those
      components, the apparatus is useless.</p>
    <p>[31] The components of cilia are single molecules. This means
      that there are no more black boxes to invoke; the complexity of
      the cilium is final, fundamental. And just as scientists, when
      they began to learn the complexities of the cell, realized how
      silly it was to think that life arose spontaneously in a single
      step or a few steps from ocean mud, so too we now realize that the
      complex cilium can not be reached in a single step or a few steps.
      But since the complexity of the cilium is irreducible, then it can
      not have functional precursors. Since the irreducibly complex
      cilium can not have functional precursors it can not be produced
      by natural selection, which requires a continuum of function to
      work. Natural selection is powerless when there is no function to
      select. We can go further and say that, if the cilium can not be
      produced by natural selection, then the cilium was designed.</p>
    <h3 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The Study of
      "Molecular Evolution"</h3>
    <p>[32] Other examples of irreducible complexity abound, including
      aspects of protein transport, blood clotting, closed circular DNA,
      electron transport, the bacterial flagellum, telomeres,
      photosynthesis, transcription regulation, and much more. Examples
      of irreducible complexity can be found on virtually every page of
      a biochemistry textbook. But if these things cannot be explained
      by Darwinian evolution, how has the scientific community regarded
      these phenomena of the past forty years? A good place to look for
      an answer to that question is in the <em>Journal of Molecular
        Evolution.</em> <em>JME</em> is a journal that was begun
      specifically to deal with the topic of how evolution occurs on the
      molecular level. It has high scientific standards, and is edited
      by prominent figures in the field. In a recent issue of <em>JME</em>
      there were published eleven articles; of these, all eleven were
      concerned simply with the analysis of protein or DNA sequences.
      None of the papers discussed detailed models for intermediates in
      the development of complex biomolecular structures. In the past
      ten years <em>JME</em> has published 886 papers. Of these, 95
      discussed the chemical synthesis of molecules thought to be
      necessary for the origin of life, 44 proposed mathematical models
      to improve sequence analysis, 20 concerned the evolutionary
      implications of current structures, and 719 were analyses of
      protein or polynucleotide sequences. There were zero papers
      discussing detailed models for intermediates in the development of
      complex biomolecular structures. This is not a peculiarity of <em>JME.</em>
      No papers are to be found that discuss detailed models for
      intermediates in the development of complex biomolecular
      structures in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of
        Science, Nature, Science,</em> the <em>Journal of Molecular
        Biology</em> or, to my knowledge, any journal whatsoever.</p>
    <p>[33] Sequence comparisons overwhelmingly dominate the literature
      of molecular evolution. But sequence comparisons simply can't
      account for the development of complex biochemical systems any
      more than Darwin's comparison of simple and complex eyes told him
      how vision worked. Thus in this area science is mute. This means
      that when we infer that complex biochemical systems were designed,
      we are contradicting no experimental result, we are in conflict
      with no theoretical study. No experiments needs to be questioned,
      but the interpretation of all experiments must now be reexamined,
      just as the results of experiments that were consistent with a
      Newtonian view of the universe had to be reinterpreted when the
      waveparticle duality of matter was discerned.</p>
    <h3 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>[34] It is often said that science must avoid any conclusions
      which smack of the supernatural. But this seems to me to be both
      bad logic and bad science. Science is not a game in which
      arbitrary rules are used to decide what explanations are to be
      permitted. Rather, it is an effort to make true statements about
      physical reality. It was only about sixty years ago that the
      expansion of the universe was first observed. This fact
      immediately suggested a singular event--that at some time in the
      distant past the universe began expanding from an extremely small
      size. To many people this inference was loaded with overtones of a
      supernatural event--the creation, the beginning of the universe.
      The prominent physicist A.S. Eddington probably spoke for many
      physicists in voicing his disgust with such a notion <a href="#8">8</a><a
        name="note8" id="note8"></a>:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="blockquote">Philosophically,
      the notion of an abrupt beginning to the present order of Nature
      is repugnant to me, as I think it must be to most; and even those
      who would welcome a proof of the intervention of a Creator will
      probably consider that a single windingup at some remote epoch is
      not really the kind of relation between God and his world that
      brings satisfaction to the mind.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, the Big Bang hypothesis was embraced by physics and
      over the years has proven to be a very fruitful paradigm. The
      point here is that physics followed the data where it seemed to
      lead, even though some thought the model gave aid and comfort to
      religion. In the present day, as biochemistry multiplies examples
      of fantastically complex molecular systems, systems which
      discourage even an attempt to explain how they may have arisen, we
      should take a lesson from physics. The conclusion of design flows
      naturally from the data; we should not shrink from it; we should
      embrace it and build on it.</p>
    <p>[35] In concluding, it is important to realize that we are not
      inferring design from what we do not know, but from what we do
      know. We are not inferring design to account for a black box, but
      to account for an open box. A man from a primitive culture who
      sees an automobile might guess that it was powered by the wind or
      by an antelope hidden under the car, but when he opens up the hood
      and sees the engine he immediately realizes that it was designed.
      In the same way biochemistry has opened up the cell to examine
      what makes it run and we see that it, too, was designed.</p>
    <p>[36] It was a shock to people of the nineteenth century when they
      discovered, from observations science had made, that many features
      of the biological world could be ascribed to the elegant principle
      of natural selection. It is a shock to us in the twentieth century
      to discover, from observations science has made, that the
      fundamental mechanisms of life cannot be ascribed to natural
      selection, and therefore were designed. But we must deal with our
      shock as best we can and go on. The theory of undirected evolution
      is already dead, but the work of science continues.</p>

          of Washington rhetorician John Angus Campbell has observed

          them among themselves, but keep the persuasively useful parts
          to scare away the uninformed." "The Comic Frame and the
