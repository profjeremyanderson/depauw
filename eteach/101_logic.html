            <font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">The word
                "argument" has different meanings in different contexts.
                Often it means "a verbal dispute," as in "Joe and Ray
                had an argument over money." In mathematics it can mean
                "an independent variable in a function." In literature
                it may refer to the plot of a play or book. </span><br

              <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">In philosophy, we use
                "argument" somewhat differently. Philosophers, like
                other people, try to get you to believe things: that
                animals have (or don't have) rights, that we should be
                virtuous, that the universe consists of minds and ideas
                and nothing else, and on and on. To get you to believe
                something, philosophers give you reasons--we call them <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">premises</span>: some
                statement or statements that are supposed to show you
                why some other statement (called the <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">conclusion</span>) is true
                or likely true. Premises and conclusion together make an
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">argument</span>. To
                give you a precise definition (which you should memorize
                and remember forever after):</span><br

            <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Georgia;"><font
                size="-1">In philosophy, an <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">argument </span>is a set of two or more
                statements. One of the statements is called the <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">conclusion, </span>and the
                other(s) are called <span style="font-weight: bold;">premises</span>.
                The <span style="font-weight: bold;">premises </span>of

                an argument are supposed to support, or give us
                reason(s) to believe, the <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">conclusion</span>. That is, premises are
                supposed to show the conclusion is true or likely true.
                (Whether the premises <span style="font-style: italic;">succeed

                </span>in showing the conclusion is true or likely true
                is another story. But even if they try to and fail, the
                set of statements is still an argument.)[<a name="ref1"></a><a

              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">Sometimes in
                philosophical discussions, "argument" refers only to the
                premises, as in "You think X? What's your argument for
                that?" But usually "argument" refers to the premises <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">and </span>the conclusion
                they're supposed support.</span><br style="font-family:

              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">Below you will find
                several examples of arguments with their premises and
                conclusions neatly labeled. Very often, however,
                arguments do not come in such plain form. To understand
                philosophy you must find the arguments in what people
                say and write. You must, in other words, identify what
                it is they want you to believe, and what reasons they
                give you to believe it. It's not that hard to do, but it
                takes practice. As you read philosophical (and other)
                works, just keep asking yourself what the author is
                trying to persuade you of. What is the main point being
                made? And what reasons are being offered in favor of it?

              O<span style="font-family: Georgia;">nce you find the
                arguments, you must then evaluate them; that is, check
                and see whether they're good. The point of this reading
                is to help you identify the two main types of
                arguments--inductive and deductive--and give you tips on
                evaluating them. Because most of the arguments we will
                encounter in this course are deductive, we will focus
                most on how to evaluate deductive arguments. </span></font>

                evaluate an argument, it is helpful to notice is what
                type of argument it is. There are two main types of
                arguments: <span style="font-weight: bold;">inductive </span>and

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">deductive</span>. First
                we'll take a quick look at <span style="font-weight:

                them, and then move on to deductive arguments. <br>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><span

                Also notice that we can strengthen the argument by
                adding more premises, like this:</span><br

                4. I've traveled around the world examining crows and

                5. I've asked everyone I've met, and they've all

                argument.<br>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><span

                true it's still possible that somewhere there was a
                white crow, or a yellow one, that I never heard about.
                The conclusion here is at best probably true. </span><br

              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">There is a common
                misconception about inductive arguments which I would
                like you to avoid. Notice that the inductive arguments
                given above both argue "from specific to general," that
                is, they derive a general claim (that <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">all </span>crows are
                black) from specific examples (<span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">this </span>crow is black, <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">that </span>one is black,
                etc.). Since many inductive arguments work like this,
                people are apt to think that this is a defining feature
                of inductive arguments. However, this is not true. Here
                is an example of an inductive argument that does not go
                from specific to general: </span><br

            <font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Since
                they don't even try to guarantee that their conclusions
                are true, it's pointless to criticize an inductive
                argument by saying, "That conclusion's not necessarily
                true!" That's something we just take for granted in
                inductive reasoning. Rather, we need to consider two
                things: <span style="font-weight: bold;">First, we need
                  to ask whether the premises are true.</span> If I was
                lying about having traveled around the world, for
                example, our confidence in the conclusion may be
                undermined. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
              <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
              <span style="font-family: Georgia;"><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Second, we need to consider
                  how strongly the premises support the conclusion even
                  if they're all true.</span> There's often no
                absolutely certain way to figure this out, but we can
                make some rough judgments; for example, the second
                version of the crow argument is much stronger than the
                first because if premises 1-6 are all true there is less
                chance the conclusion is false than if just premises 1-3
                are. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp; </span><br
                style="font-family: Georgia;">
              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">There is a large
                literature on inductive arguments, and deservedly so:
                most of the judgments we make in our ordinary lives can
                be characterized as judgments based on induction. When
                you leave your umbrella at home because it is sunny when
                you go out, you are reasoning that rain is <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">improbable</span>, not
                impossible. Because the conclusions of inductions are
                never completely certain, philosophers very often avoid
                using inductive arguments and instead try to make
                deductive arguments to persuade us of things. </span></font>

                  arguments, at best, show their conclusions are true,
                  not just likely true<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>.</span>
                This is a much higher standard of persuasion, and
                difficult to meet. But it's something many philosophers
                aspire to, and understandably so: no matter how strong
                an inductive argument you make, you must always admit
                that there is some reason to doubt its conclusion. But
                if you can make a strong (that is, "sound") deductive
                argument, you can set aside your doubts. The conclusion
                is true, period. </span><br style="font-family:

              <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">Here is a very simple
                deductive argument: </span><br style="font-family:

            <font size="-1"><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">We can see that the
                premises don't just make the conclusion probably true;
                they make it true. Since the point of presenting an
                argument is to persuade someone that something is true,
                deductive arguments can be very helpful. That's why many
                philosophers (and non-philosophers) try to give
                deductive arguments to try to persuade you of things. </span><br

              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">Just as it is often
                said, wrongly, of inductive arguments that they go from
                specific to general, it is often said--wrongly--of
                deductive arguments that they go "from general to
                specific," that is, that they all assert some general
                principle (like "<span style="font-weight: bold;">All </span>humans

                are mortal") and then apply it to some specific case
                (like "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Jeremy </span>is

                a human"), as the above example does. Even an
                introductory textbook I used to use, <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">Philosophy Made Simple</span>,
                makes these claims.[<a name="ref3"></a><a href="#note3">3</a>]
                Many deductive arguments do argue from general to
                specific, but not all. Consider the following example: </span><br
                style="font-family: Georgia;">
              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp; </span><br

                3. Minnie is a mouse. <br>
                4. Mickey is another mouse. <br>
                5. Therefore, two mice are here. <br>

              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">Even though it only
                contains specific claims, this is still a deductive
                argument because it tries to establish its conclusion as
                true, not just probably true. For that matter, deductive
                arguments can go "from general to general," like this
                one: </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">

              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">The point is that <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">specificity or generality
                  has nothing to do with whether an argument is
                  inductive or deductive.</span> If an argument only
                tries to establish that its conclusion is probably true,
                it is inductive. If it tries to prove that its
                conclusion is true, it is deductive. </span></font> <br

                arguments are faulty. Some arguments are so obviously
                bad that you reject them at first sight. But other
                faulty arguments may look quite appealing, and you may
                be fooled by them if you're not careful. So it's good to
                have some tools with which to evaluate arguments. To
                evaluate deductive arguments it's very handy to
                understand two concepts philosophers use: <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">validity </span>and <span

              <br>
              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">First, let's explain <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">validity</span>. Just as
                the word "argument" has a technical meaning in
                philosophy which is different from its meaning in
                ordinary conversation, in philosophy we use the term
                "valid" in a special way which you must learn and keep
                in mind. In ordinary conversation, we tend to say that
                something is valid when we think it's true, or right, or
                reasonable; it's a vague term of approval. But in
                philosophy, "valid" means something very different, and
                very precise. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
              <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">Look again at the

              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">It has a certain
                structure or pattern to it. We can begin to see that
                pattern by looking at similar arguments. For example:<br>
              </span></font>

                exactly the same way. In logic, we say that they have
                the same <span style="font-weight: bold;">form</span>.
                We can see this form more clearly when we take away
                particulars like "humans," "mortal," "Jeremy," "planet,"
                and so on:<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> </span><br

                matter what we substitute for "A," "B," and "X," the
                conclusion will still be logically entailed by the
                premises. This makes the argument's form valid. Another
                way to express validity is this: <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
                  <br>
                </span></span></font>

            <font size="-1"><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">Note the word "if" in
                the previous sentence. It means that a valid argument
                does not necessarily have true premises or a true
                conclusion. In philosophy, saying "That's a valid
                argument" doesn't tell you anything about whether its
                premises or conclusion are true. It only tells you that

              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">OK, so now you have
                some idea what an argument's form is, and you know that
                validity has to do with an argument's form. And you've
                noticed that validity&#8212;good form&#8212;isn't enough, by itself,
                for a deductive argument to prove its conclusion is
                true. Just to emphasize that point, let's consider one
                last example: </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp; </span><br

                hair. <br>
                2. President Bush is Jeremy's only brother-in-law. <br>
                3. So, President Bush has bright purple hair. <br>

                style="font-family: Georgia;">
              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">This argument is
                valid; we can see that if the premises were true the
                conclusion would also be true. But we know that
                President Bush does not have bright purple hair, so
                something must be wrong: one or more of the premises
                must be false. In this example, both premises happen to
                be false: I have no brother-in-law at all, let alone
                President Bush. </span><br style="font-family:

                  style="font-weight: bold;">When you find a deductive

                  ask two questions: </span></span><br

              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp; </span><br

                the argument valid?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;
                color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
              <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">2.
                Are the premises true?</span><font size="-1"><br>

              <span style="font-family: Georgia;"><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">If the answer to both
                  questions is "Yes," then the argument is sound </span>and

                you have very strong reason to believe the conclusion is
                true. In fact, if the argument is sound it would be <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">irrational </span>for you
                to deny the conclusion. But if the answer is "No" to
                either question, the argument is <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">unsound </span>and you
                have reason to be skeptical about whether the conclusion
                is true. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
              <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">Note that I said "you
                have reason to be skeptical" (that is, you may reserve
                judgment) about the conclusion--not that you should
                reject it as false. Why? Consider the following example:
              </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp; </span><br
                style="font-family: Georgia;">

                2. The moon is made of green cheese. <br>
                3. Therefore, the earth is round. <br>
              </font> </div>
            <font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp; </span><br
                style="font-family: Georgia;">
              <span style="font-family: Georgia;">This argument's form
                is invalid; its premises have no logical connection to
                the conclusion. And premise 2 is false: the moon isn't
                made of green cheese; we all know it's made of feta
                cheese, which is why it's white. Yet even so, the
                conclusion is true. So some caution is in order: even if
                an argument is unsound (that is, even if its premises
                don't give you good reason to believe its conclusion),
                the conclusion might still be true. <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Even if the reasons given
                  for a conclusion are bad, there may be good reasons
                  for that conclusion lurking out there somewhere.</span>
