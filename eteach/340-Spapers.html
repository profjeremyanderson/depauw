            <ul style="font-family: Georgia;">
              <li><font size="-1">Your paper should be primarily
                  argumentative. That is, it must defend a conclusion
                  which other smart people might well disagree with, and
                  this must be your paper's major focus. <br>

              <li><font size="-1">To take a stand effectively, your
                  paper must be critical but fair to your opposition,
                  and your papers' conclusions should not depend on mere
                  expressions of personal opinion or armchair arguments.
                  It is not enough to explain why you think something is
                  so; you must strive to convince a reasonable reader
                  that any right-thinking person should agree with you.<br>

                  Rich Text Format (.rtf) file, or share a Google doc.
                  Papers should be double spaced, have one-inch margins
                  and numbered pages, use 12-point Times New Roman or
                  similar font, and be free of mechanical errors
                  (grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc.). Your
                  computer's grammar- and spell-checking features are
                  not adequate; you will have to proofread your paper
                  yourself. Include a word count for the body of the
                  paper (that is, not including your name, end- or
                  footnotes, bibliography, etc.) at the top with your
                  identifying information.</font><font size="-1"> <br>

                  those who try to impress readers with big words and

                In this course you'll write three short papers on issues

                words, about 4-5 pages. <br>
                <br>
                Choose your own topics. One place to look for potential
                topics is in your reading responses: what portion of the
                readings has most intrigued you? Is there a particular
                argument or issue you want to write about? Feel free to

                correct, or that Hobbes's social contract theory is a
                load of bunk. (These would be tough to do even in a long
                paper.) Instead, take on some smaller but significant
                part, such as the "noble lie" or Hobbes's reasons for
                insisting a sovereign must be above the law. It often
                works well to find a specific argument given in a text
                and critically evaluate it: is its conclusion correct?

                  government does not serve the interests of the
                  governed, but rather serves the interests of the
                  rulers. To what extent can his position be defended? <br>

              <li><font size="-1">Thrasymachus implies that when they
                  obey the rules, the "weak" (citizens) are the victim
                  of a conspiracy perpetrated by the "strong" (rulers).
                  In The Genealogy of Morals, Friedrich Nietzsche argues
                  that the opposite has been the case in Western
                  history: that obedience to (moral) rules is a way the
                  weak have managed to subdue the strong. You might
                  critically evaluate either or both of these stances. <br>

                  for example, claims that the interests of a monarch
                  coincide with the interests of citizens. To what

              <li style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">There's
                  a constant tension between the need to protect people
                  against harms (security) and freedom. How can we
                  determine the proper balance? (You might want to

              <li style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">Several
                  of our authors say that although rulers ought to be
                  good to those they rule, they may treat others
                  --whether foreign governments or individuals--less
                  kindly. (Some examples: Plato's dog that is kind to
                  friends but fierce to outsiders; Hobbes on princes as
                  gladiators, and his remarks on conquest; Locke on
                  enslavement; etc.) You could pick one of these and
                  critically evaluate it, or state and defend your own
                  position on government's obligations to those outside
                  its jurisdiction. <br>

                  construction and maintenance; various military
                  functions including housing and feeding soldiers,
                  bodyguarding, intelligence gathering; etc.) You might
                  choose one such area and critically assess whether its
                  privatization is appropriate and/or beneficial. <br>
