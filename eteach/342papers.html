                  you only use material from an AI when you can verify

                  to interacting intelligently with the world. Without

              <br>
              Here are some possible examples:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>If you copy any text generated by an AI (whether
                  it's just a turn of phrase or something more), put it
                  in quotation marks and cite the AI.</li>
                <li>If you use anything (such as an idea, or an example)
                  you got from an AI without copying the words, still
                  cite the AI.</li>
                <li>If you use an AI to correct your grammar, spelling,
                  punctuation, etc., or to help outline your paper, say
                  so, and cite the AI. </li>
              </ul>
              In short, if you use AI to affect the content of your work
              in any way whatsoever (wording, ideas, examples,
              arguments, grammar, punctuation, organization, etc.),
              document it. And, of course, the more work the AI does,
              the less credit you earn. <br>
              <br>
              This is merely an extension of the plagiarism policy
              above, and reflects the main goal of academic integrity
              generally, which is to give credit for any help you got. <br>
              <br>
              As always, if you are unsure what's OK, ask me, preferably
              before turning work in. <br>
              <br>
              Like the rest of these academic integrity instructions,
              this policy applies to reading responses, drafts, papers,
              and take-home exams (if any). Citing and quoting are not
              required for in-class exams because for them you must
              write solely from memory.<br>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Your paper should be
              primarily argumentative. That is, you must defend a
              conclusion which other smart people might well disagree
              with, and this must be your paper's major focus. If you'd

              <br>
              Since other smart people might well disagree with you, you
              should discuss some objection(s) to your stance.<br>

            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 80px;">Start your paper with a
              short introduction including a thesis and road map. By
              "short" I mean no more than half a page in a short paper,
              no more than a page in a long paper. In the intro, clearly
              state what overall point you will argue for (your thesis)
              and briefly explain the main steps you'll take in the
              paper to argue for that point (your road map). The thesis
              and road map are the most important things in your
              introduction. <br>
              <br>
              Submit your paper as a Word (.docx or .doc) or Rich Text
              Format (.rtf) file, or share a Google doc. Please no PDF's
              or Pages files. <br>
              <br>
              Put your name at the top. Double space, one-inch margins,
              numbered pages, 12-point Times New Roman or similar font.<br>
              <br>
              As far as style goes, I am more impressed by writers who
              express ideas clearly using simple language than by those
              who use big words and long sentences. It is better to
              write like Michael Moore (see "The Argument for
              Retributivism") and less like <a target="_blank"
                href="http://www.utilitarianism.com/ol/one.html">John
                Stuart Mill</a>. (I only commend Moore's style, not his
              logic.) You may write in first person if you like. <br>
              <br>
              Proofread carefully. Do not trust your college GPA to your
              computer's grammar- and spell-checkers.<br>

            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Each of your short papers
              should be about 1200-1500 words long (roughly 4-5 pages).
              In each, take a position regarding some of the material we
              have studied and defend it against some objection(s). <br>
              <br>
              Since the paper is short, you will need to limit its
              scope. Take on a small question rather than a large one.
              For example, do not try to show that natural law is
              superior to legal positivism, or decide whether the
              insanity defense should be eliminated. (These would be
              tough to do even in your research paper.) It may also be
              too much to take on the argument of an entire text. For
              example, Kadish's article "The Criminal Law and the Luck
              of the Draw" has three main theses and considers failed
              attempts, culpable risk creation, impossible attempts, the
              purposes of the criminal law...lots of big issues, with
              multiple arguments concerning several of them. That is too
              much to take on in a short paper. Instead, choose some
              particular argument in a text. For example, is Kadish
              right to reject a retributive justification for the harm
              doctrine? Or, is he right that the harm doctrine fails to
              serve the purpose of the criminal law? Or you might set
              aside the question of whether an author's conclusion is
              correct and focus more on the quality of an argument,
              critically evaluating it. Or you might write about a legal
              ruling such as <span style="font-style: italic;">People
                v. Dlugash</span>. Rulings often contain multiple
              arguments, any one of which may be worth critically
              evaluating.<br>
              <br>
              Pick a topic that interests you. One place to look for
              potential topics is in your own reading responses: what
              portion of the readings has most intrigued you? Is there a
              particular argument or issue you want to write about? Feel
              free to discuss possible topics with me.<br>

              Obviously your argument regarding one assigned text may be
              helped, or opposed, by points made by the author of

                  in your paper outside of assigned materials which,

                  materials do not count as research. Demonstrate
                  understanding of those sources in your paper. Six is a
                  suggested minimum (i.e., necessary to get a passing
                  grade); to write a really good paper you will likely

                    like "When, if ever, is it OK to use a forced
                    confession?" or "How much can President Trump be
                    held liable for the January 6 insurrection?" At this
                    point I don't expect you to have settled on
                    answer.&nbsp; In fact, settling on an answer to your
                    question before doing your research is a bad idea;
                    you should follow the evidence rather than
                    committing to an answer in advance. <br>

                  <li>A brief -- maybe half a page or so -- description

                  <li>A bibliography of several sources you think you
                    might use. For each source, include at least a brief
                    note of a sentence or two explaining how that source
                    is relevant to your topic. Relax: I do not expect
                    this to be a complete or final list of your sources!
                    Rather, the point of this is to get you started on

            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">These are just suggestions!
              Before latching onto something I mention below, I urge you
              to find something that really interests you. For example:<br>
              <ul>
                <li> Think back over what we've covered and ask yourself
                  which topic, article, argument, case, etc. most
                  excited you, inspired you, or annoyed you. Build a
                  topic based on that.</li>
                <li> Go through our textbook's the Table of Contents,
                  including what we have not covered, and see what
                  sparks your interest. <br>
                </li>
                <li>Consider some real-life situation or event that has
                  captured your interest, and make it your focus.</li>
              </ul>
              Below I suggest broad areas for you to think about. For
              your paper it will probably be better to zoom in on
              something more specific: some particular text(s) or
              dispute within a subject area, some particular case(s),
              etc. That will help make your paper more focused and
              persuasive.<br>

                basis, if any, is there for claiming that nations (as
                opposed to citizens within nations) are bound by some
                law(s)? What is this law, where does it come from, who
                may be held accountable for violating it, and so on? You
                could consider this in regard to some case brought up in
                the book (like the trial of Slobodan Milosovic) or
                elsewhere (like the disagreement between the US and
                Iran). Alternatively, what claims may one nation or its

                are laws, both domestic and international, regarding the
                recourse to war. There is often disagreement over their
                application. For example, there was considerable
                controversy over the legality of the US invasion of
                Iraq, with the Bush Administration citing multiple legal
                justifications for the invasion and opponents claiming
                the invasion was illegal. Who was right? How can we

                the Allied bombing of Dresden in World War II) or a
                present-day case (like the Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006,

                since the Bush Administration. President Bush claimed
                the right to declare anyone to be an "enemy combatant"
                and hold them indefinitely without charge, trial, or
                without review; to employ coercive interrogation
                techniques (i.e., torture); to assassinate people; to
                selectively ignore laws passed by Congress through the
                use of "signing statements," and other measures
                allegedly justified by the "unitary executive" theory of
                the presidency and the exigencies of war. President
                Obama has claimed and employed several of these powers
                as well. To what extent do such measures (or one of them
                -- say, suspension of habeas corpus) have constitutional

                  national security. </span>A number of recent events
                have highlighted the tension between the value of
                freedom and the value of security. For example,
                Congress, the Supreme Court, and the Bush Administration
                have been criticised for abridging civil liberties
                through the Patriot Act, various rulings, and uses of
                executive power. At the same time, news organizations
                and WikiLeaks have been criticized for revealing
                controversial government activities, such as large-scale
                warrantless wiretapping and bank surveillance, because
                such leaks allegedly help our enemies. Vice President
                Cheney suggested that even debating US policy on the war
                in Iraq emboldens our enemies. How should these
                (apparently) competing values be weighed? Must security
                override liberty, or vice versa? You might consider some
                particular law, ruling, initiative, or event such as one
                of those mentioned above or one of many others.<br>

                become a popular alternative to going to court. You
                could consider one or more of these alternatives, and
                ask how well they compare with the court system.<br>

                was discussed in class, traditional punishments such as
                prison don't always achieve their goals very
                effectively. What alternatives are there? In what sorts

                explore. You might pick one such issue and critically
                evaluate some relevant law(s), or consider what law(s)
                would be most appropriate for our society with regard to
                it (if any -- you might consider whether the law has any

                people are "privileged." Priests, reporters, spouses,

                required to keep some conversations private even if
                those conversations might reveal criminal activity. How

                  style="font-style: italic;">Griswold v. Connecticut </span>--






























                the Supreme Court has held that we have a right to
                privacy and that this right is fundamental despite not
                being mentioned in the Constitution. Further, this right
                to privacy has been held to protect activities widely
                regarded as immoral, such as abortion and gay sex.
                However, the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">Roe v. Wade</span>,
                permitting states to restrict access to abortion. You
                might examine any part of this: the legal justification
                for a right to privacy; the notion of fundamental rights
                and whether privacy is one; or whether the (alleged)
                right to privacy should allow us more or less liberty
                than it has been held to, etc.<br>
