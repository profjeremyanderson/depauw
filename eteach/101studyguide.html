            The examinations in this course will cover the items in this
            study guide. Our exams are comprehensive: each one covers
            all material previously presented in the course. The
            exception is this: after an exam, some items on the study
            guide will be struck out (<span style="text-decoration:

            will not appear on any future exams.<br>

                expectations--including some sample answers</span></font><br>
            <ul>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">For a <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">term</span>, can you give
                its definition + say why it matters in this course?</li>
              <ul>
                <li>For example, for "valid," you should be able to<br>
                  (a) define it, like "Validity is something deductive
                  arguments can have. An argument is valid when its
                  conclusion would have to be true if its premises were
                  true," and also<br>
                  (b) explain why the term matters in the course. You
                  could say, "Validity matters in this course because we
                  often evaluate arguments, and seeing whether an
                  argument is valid helps us figure out whether its
                  conclusion is well supported."</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>To say why a term matters, can you say something <span
                      style="font-style: italic;">specific </span>about
                    that term? Vague answers like, "Term X matters in
                    philosophy because philosophers discuss X" or
                    "because we studied X in the course" do not show
                    much understanding.</li>
                  <li>Instead, identify where the term played a role in
                    the course, and what that role was. <br>
                  </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>For example, "strong." It came up in basic
                      logic, where discussed arguments and how to
                      evaluate them. So, for "strong," you could say "It
                      matters in this course because it is relevant to
                      how we evaluate inductive arguments; this is
                      important because arguments are the most basic
                      tool of philosophy."</li>
                    <li>Or "primary quality." You could say, "Locke uses
                      the term; he&nbsp; distinguishes primary qualities
                      from secondary qualities so he can say how some of
                      our sensations actually resemble things around us
                      while some sensations don't. Locke thinks this
                      helps us tell how accurate our sensations are."<br>
                      <br>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">For a <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">name</span>, can you
                identify the main points that person made in the
                assigned reading?</li>
              <ul>
                <li>For example, for "St. Anselm of Canterbury," can you
                  say more than just that he gave an argument for God?
                  Identify the main points he made in the assigned
                  readings, like this: "Anselm argued that God exists.
                  To do that, he gave a deductive, ontological argument.
                  He also replied to Gaunilo's objections to his
                  argument."</li>
                <li>Or for for "Bertrand Russell," can you do more than
                  just describe his argument about the cat? Identify the
                  main points he made in the assigned portion of <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">The Problems of
                    Philosophy</span>, like this: "Russell was writing
                  about our knowledge of the external world, and he
                  argued that although (a) appearances often differ from
                  (what we take to be) reality, and (b) we cannot prove
                  that life isn't just a continuous dream or illusion,
                  nevertheless (c) we can still be confident that things
                  like cats and people do exist outside us."<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">For an <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">argument</span>, can
                you...</li>
              <ul>
                <li>State the argument? You might state it in standard
                  form (numbered premises and conclusion) and/or write
                  it out in a paragraph. But however you state it, you
                  need to both identify its premises and, for each
                  conclusion, explain how that conclusion is supposed to
                  be supported by the premises. Even if you put it in
                  standard form, you still need to explain.</li>
                <li>Critically evaluate the argument, if this was
                  discussed in class? For example, for Descartes's
                  argument for corporeal objects, be able to explain its
                  weaknesses. You may not be able to explain them all --
                  in fact, trying to do that would be too much -- but
                  even in an exam you should be able to identify at
                  least one substantial criticism of an argument if
                  asked to, if those were discussed in class.</li>

                </li>
              </ol>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">You should be able to:</span><br>
              <ol>
                <li>Explain how R&eacute;e argues that our choices are
                  determined by his comparison of the stone, the donkey,
                  and us (531-4).<br>
                </li>
                <li>Explain how R&eacute;e and Eagleman account for our
                  belief that we have free will (536-8; Eagleman, 3-5).
                  (It will be helpful to discuss Eagleman's "stowaway"
                  and "newspaper" comparisons.)<br>
                </li>
                <li>How does R&eacute;e argue that we are not
                  responsible for what we do (R&eacute;e 425; class
                  notes)<br>
                </li>
                <li>According to Campbell, three conditions must be met
                  to have free will and be morally responsible. What are
                  they (Campbell, section 2, 545-7)?<br>
                </li>
                <li>What choices does Campbell say are free (and for
                  which we may be responsible) (550, end of section 5)?
                  Give an example of a free choice, and explain why it's
                  an example.<br>
                </li>
                <li>How does Campbell argue that introspection is good
                  evidence of free will (Campbell, 550)? Why is this
                  really not very strong evidence (Campbell, 550; class
                  notes)?<br>
                </li>
                <li>Explain how a determinist could argue that our
                  predictability shows that we do not have free will
                  (Campbell, section 9, 552). Then, explain Campbell's
                  replies to this argument (552-3; class notes).</li>
                <li>Explain why Ayer is unsure whether determinism is
                  true (439-40). If determinism is false, and our
                  choices are undetermined, does Ayer think we would
                  then be responsible for our choices? How come (440)?<br>
                </li>
                <li>How does Ayer try to show we can be responsible even
                  if we are determined? Specifically, when does Ayer
                  think we are "free" and responsible, and when does he
                  think we are not? (To do this well, you will need to
                  explain Ayer's definition of freedom, his criterion
                  for responsibility, and what he thinks constraints
                  are, 441-2.) <br>

                  clearly identifying what he thinks makes it
                  meaningless (1-3, 4). (It would be good to illustrate
                  it, as he does, with the myth of Sisyphus or something
                  similar.)<br>
                </li>
                <li>Explain why Taylor thinks the glow worms' lives are

                  meaningless, too, despite our differences from the
                  worms (5-6, 7).<br>
                </li>
                <li>Taylor considers two possibilities for what might
                  count as a meaningful life. Identify each one, and
                  explain why he rejects one and accepts the other
                  (7-9).<br>

                <li>Explain what Tolstoy thinks fails to give life
                  meaning (Tolstoy, 1-7). It may be helpful to discuss
                  the "Eastern story about the traveler" (3): what does
                  it suggest about Tolstoy's attitude towards death, his

                <li>Explain what Tolstoy thinks does make life
                  meaningful (7-8). Why does he think it does this?<br>

                <li>Compare Tolstoy's proposal for a good/meaningful
                  life with (a) Chuang-tzu's and (b) Taylor's. How are

                    which are with our class notes</a>). Explain what
                  conclusions he draws from them--i.e., how they justify
                  government, and what sort of good "the many" think
