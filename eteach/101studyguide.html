            The examinations in this course will cover the items in this
            study guide. Our exams are comprehensive: each one covers
            all material previously presented in the course. The
            exception: after an exam, some items on the study guide will
            be struck out (<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">so




















              they look like this</span>). Those items will not appear
            on any future exams.<br>

                expectations--including some sample answers</span></font><br>
            <ul>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">For a <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">term</span>, can you give
                its definition + say why it matters in this course?</li>
              <ul>
                <li>For example, for "metaphysics, you should be able to
                  <br>
                  (a) define it, like "Metaphysics is the area of
                  philosophy that mainly asks, 'What exists?' It also
                  asks related questions like 'Does God exist?' 'Are
                  numbers real?' or 'What is the difference between a
                  person and their body?'" and <span style="font-style:
                    italic;">also</span><br>
                  (b) say why it matters in the course. You could say,
                  "Metaphysics matters in this course because it is one
                  of the three main areas of philosophy. We also studied
                  free will, and whether we have free will is a
                  metaphysical question."<br>
                </li>
                <li>Or, for "valid," you should be able to<br>
                  (a) define it, like "Validity is something deductive
                  arguments can have. An argument is valid when its
                  conclusion would have to be true if its premises were
                  true," and <span style="font-style: italic;">also</span><br>
                  (b) explain why the term matters in the course. You
                  could say, "Validity matters in this course because we
                  often evaluate arguments, and seeing whether an
                  argument is valid helps us figure out whether its
                  conclusion is well supported."<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">To say why a term
                    matters, can you say something </span><span
                    style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">specific
















                  </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">about that
                    term? </span>Vague answers like, "Term X matters in
                  philosophy because philosophers discuss X" or "because
                  we studied X in the course" do not show understanding.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Instead, identify
                    where the term played a role in the course, and what
                    that role was. </span><br>
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>For example, "libertarianism." It came up in our
                    discussion of free will; you could say,
                    "Libertarianism matters in this course because it is
                    one of the three main solutions philosophers have to
                    the problem of free will." <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Or "strong." It comes up in basic logic, where
                    discussed arguments and how to evaluate them. So,
                    for "strong," you could say "It matters in this
                    course because it is relevant to how we evaluate
                    inductive arguments; this is important because
                    arguments are the most basic tool of philosophy."</li>
                  <li>Or "monism." You could say, "Monism is related to
                    the mind/body problem. It is one way of solving the
                    problem: if there is only one substance in the
                    universe, then there is no need to explain how two
                    different substances could interact. Berkeley is a
                    monist."<br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">For a <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">name</span>, can you
                identify the main points that person made in the
                assigned reading?</li>
              <ul>
                <li>For example, for "Paul R&eacute;e," can you say more
                  than that he was a hard determinist? Identify the main
                  points he made in the assigned reading, like
                  "R&eacute;e believed there is no free will because
                  everything in the universe is determined by a
                  sufficient cause. He argued for this by comparing a
                  stone, a donkey, and a person. Because we are
                  determined, he believed we cannot be responsible for
                  our actions and that our belief we are free is
                  mistaken." <br>
                </li>
                <li>Or, for "St. Anselm of Canterbury," can you say more
                  than just that he gave an argument for God? Identify
                  the main points he made in the assigned readings, like
                  this: "Anselm argued that God exists. To do that, he
                  gave a deductive, ontological argument. He also
                  replied to Gaunilo's objections to his argument."</li>
                <li>Or for "Bertrand Russell," can you do more than just
                  describe his argument about the cat? Identify the main
                  points he made in the assigned portion of <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">The Problems of
                    Philosophy</span>, like this: "Russell was writing
                  about our knowledge of the external world, and he
                  argued that although (a) appearances often differ from
                  (what we take to be) reality, and (b) we cannot prove
                  that life isn't just a continuous dream or illusion,
                  nevertheless (c) we can still be confident that things
                  like cats and people do exist outside us."<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">For an <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">argument</span>, can
                you...</li>
              <ul>
                <li>State the argument? You might state it in standard
                  form (numbered premises and conclusion) and/or write
                  it out in a paragraph, or both -- whatever best
                  demonstrates your understanding. But however you state
                  it, you should both identify its premises and, for
                  each conclusion, explain how that conclusion is
                  supposed to be supported by the premises. Even if you
                  put it in standard form, you should explain.</li>
                <li>Critically evaluate the argument, if this was
                  discussed in class? For example, for Descartes's
                  argument for corporeal objects, be able to explain its
                  weaknesses. You may not be able to explain them all --
                  in fact, trying to do that would be too much -- but
                  even in an exam you should be able to identify at
                  least one substantial criticism of an argument if
                  asked to, if those were discussed in class.</li>

                <li>Explain how R&eacute;e and Eagleman account for our

                  pp. 422-5; Eagleman, 3-5). (It may be helpful to
                  discuss Eagleman's "stowaway" or "newspaper"

                <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">According to
                  Campbell, three conditions must be met for you to be
                  morally responsible. What are they (Campbell, section

                    section 5)? Give an example of such a free choice,
                    and explain why it's an example.</span><br>
                </li>
                <li>Campbell says that introspection is good evidence of
                  free will (Campbell, 550). Why might we doubt that
                  introspection is good evidence (Eagleman, 3-5; class
                  notes)?<br>
                </li>
                <li>How might a determinist argue that our
                  predictability shows that we do not have free will
                  (Campbell, section 9, 552; class notes have a simpler
                  version you may use). Then, explain one of Campbell's
                  replies to this argument (552-3).<br>
                </li>
                <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Explain
                    why Ayer is unsure whether determinism is true
                    (439-40). If determinism is false and our choices
                    are undetermined, why does Ayer think we couldn't be
                    responsible for our choices (440)?</span><br>
                </li>
                <li>How does Ayer try to show we can be responsible even
                  if we are determined? Specifically, when does Ayer
                  think we are "free" and responsible, and when does he
                  think we are not? (To do this well, you will need to
                  explain Ayer's definition of freedom, his criterion
                  for responsibility, and what he thinks constraints
                  are, 441-2.)<br>

                <li>Explain Descartes's overall project: his goal, the
                  obstacle he faces, and how he proposes to overcome his
                  doubts (143-4).<br>

                <li>Given his method of doubt (Descartes 143), how sure
                  does Descartes have to be of something before he can
                  say he knows it? What historical reasons help explain
                  why he is so extreme (cf. Bailey, 135-6)?</li>
                <li>Explain why Descartes is certain he exists (third
                  paragraph of M2, 146).<br>
                </li>
                <li>Explain why Descartes believes he is (i.e., why in
                  M2 he is only sure of being) a "thinking thing"
                  (146-7). What does Descartes say a thinking thing is
                  (beginning of 148)?<br>

                <li>Explain why proving God exists and is no deceiver
                  would be an appropriate strategy for getting rid of
                  Defective Nature Doubt. To do this, first explain why
                  it should work (if it could be done). Then, explain
                  why it would be better than the other strategy we
                  discussed in class. (We discussed both self-serving
                  and philosophical reasons why it would be better; the
