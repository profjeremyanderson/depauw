                expectations--including some sample answers</span></font><br>
            <ul>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">For a <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">term</span>, can you give
                its definition + say why it matters in this course?</li>
              <ul>
                <li>For example, for "valid," you should be able to<br>
                  (a) define it, like "Validity is something deductive
                  arguments can have. An argument is valid when its
                  conclusion would have to be true if its premises were
                  true," and also<br>
                  (b) explain why the term matters in the course. You
                  could say, "Validity matters in this course because we
                  often evaluate arguments, and seeing whether an
                  argument is valid helps us figure out whether its
                  conclusion is well supported."</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>To say why a term matters, can you say something <span
                      style="font-style: italic;">specific </span>about
                    that term? Vague answers like, "Term X matters in
                    philosophy because philosophers discuss X" or
                    "because we studied X in the course" do not show
                    much understanding.</li>
                  <li>Instead, identify where the term played a role in
                    the course, and what that role was. <br>
                  </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>For example, "strong." It came up in basic
                      logic, where discussed arguments and how to
                      evaluate them. So, for "strong," you could say "It
                      matters in this course because it is relevant to
                      how we evaluate inductive arguments; this is
                      important because arguments are the most basic
                      tool of philosophy."</li>
                    <li>Or "monism." You could say, "Monism is related
                      to the mind/body problem. It is one way of solving
                      the problem: if there is only one substance in the
                      universe, then there is no need to explain how two
                      different substances could interact. Berkeley is a
                      monist."<br>
                      <br>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">For a <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">name</span>, can you
                identify the main points that person made in the
                assigned reading?</li>
              <ul>
                <li>For example, for "St. Anselm of Canterbury," can you
                  say more than just that he gave an argument for God?
                  Identify the main points he made in the assigned
                  readings, like this: "Anselm argued that God exists.
                  To do that, he gave a deductive, ontological argument.
                  He also replied to Gaunilo's objections to his
                  argument."</li>
                <li>Or for for "Bertrand Russell," can you do more than
                  just describe his argument about the cat? Identify the
                  main points he made in the assigned portion of <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">The Problems of
                    Philosophy</span>, like this: "Russell was writing
                  about our knowledge of the external world, and he
                  argued that although (a) appearances often differ from
                  (what we take to be) reality, and (b) we cannot prove
                  that life isn't just a continuous dream or illusion,
                  nevertheless (c) we can still be confident that things
                  like cats and people do exist outside us."<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">For an <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">argument</span>, can
                you...</li>
              <ul>
                <li>State the argument? You might state it in standard
                  form (numbered premises and conclusion) and/or write
                  it out in a paragraph. But however you state it, you
                  need to both identify its premises and, for each
                  conclusion, explain how that conclusion is supposed to
                  be supported by the premises. Even if you put it in
                  standard form, you still need to explain.</li>
                <li>Critically evaluate the argument, if this was
                  discussed in class? For example, for Descartes's
                  argument for corporeal objects, be able to explain its
                  weaknesses. You may not be able to explain them all --
                  in fact, trying to do that would be too much -- but
                  even in an exam you should be able to identify at
                  least one substantial criticism of an argument if
                  asked to, if those were discussed in class.</li>
