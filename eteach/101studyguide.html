            <ul>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">For a <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">term</span>, can you give
                its definition + say why it matters in this course?</li>
              <ul>
                <li>For example, for "valid," you should be able to<br>
                  (a) define it, like "Validity is something deductive
                  arguments can have. An argument is valid when its
                  conclusion would have to be true if its premises were
                  true," and also<br>
                  (b) explain why the term matters in the course. You
                  could say, "Validity matters in this course because we
                  often evaluate arguments, and seeing whether an
                  argument is valid helps us figure out whether its
                  conclusion is well supported."</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>To say why a term matters, can you say something <span
                      style="font-style: italic;">specific </span>about
                    that term? Vague answers like, "Term X matters in
                    philosophy because philosophers discuss X" or
                    "because we studied X in the course" do not show
                    much understanding.</li>
                  <li>Instead, identify where the term played a role in
                    the course, and what that role was. <br>
                  </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>For example, "strong." It came up in basic
                      logic, where discussed arguments and how to
                      evaluate them. So, for "strong," you could say "It
                      matters in this course because it is relevant to
                      how we evaluate inductive arguments; this is
                      important because arguments are the most basic
                      tool of philosophy."</li>
                    <li>Or "monism." You could say, "Monism is related
                      to the mind/body problem. It is one way of solving
                      the problem: if there is only one substance in the
                      universe, then there is no need to explain how two
                      different substances could interact. Berkeley is a
                      monist."<br>
                      <br>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">For a <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">name</span>, can you
                identify the main points that person made in the
                assigned reading?</li>
              <ul>
                <li>For example, for "St. Anselm of Canterbury," can you
                  say more than just that he gave an argument for God?
                  Identify the main points he made in the assigned
                  readings, like this: "Anselm argued that God exists.
                  To do that, he gave a deductive, ontological argument.
                  He also replied to Gaunilo's objections to his
                  argument."</li>
                <li>Or for for "Bertrand Russell," can you do more than
                  just describe his argument about the cat? Identify the
                  main points he made in the assigned portion of <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">The Problems of
                    Philosophy</span>, like this: "Russell was writing
                  about our knowledge of the external world, and he
                  argued that although (a) appearances often differ from
                  (what we take to be) reality, and (b) we cannot prove
                  that life isn't just a continuous dream or illusion,
                  nevertheless (c) we can still be confident that things
                  like cats and people do exist outside us."<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">For an <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">argument</span>, can
                you...</li>
              <ul>
                <li>State the argument? You might state it in standard
                  form (numbered premises and conclusion) and/or write
                  it out in a paragraph, or both -- whatever best
                  demonstrates your understanding. But however you state
                  it, you need to both identify its premises and, for
                  each conclusion, explain how that conclusion is
                  supposed to be supported by the premises. Even if you
                  put it in standard form, you still need to explain.</li>
                <li>Critically evaluate the argument, if this was
                  discussed in class? For example, for Descartes's
                  argument for corporeal objects, be able to explain its
                  weaknesses. You may not be able to explain them all --
                  in fact, trying to do that would be too much -- but
                  even in an exam you should be able to identify at
                  least one substantial criticism of an argument if
                  asked to, if those were discussed in class.</li>

              I encourage you to study with others. However, on papers

                </li>

                <li>This may seem obvious, but try to keep track of who

                    the five features of our beliefs we identified and

                <li>Explain Descartes's overall project: his goal, the
                  obstacle he faces, and how he proposes to overcome his
                  doubts (143-4).<br>
                </li>
                <li>Explain how Descartes's standard for what counts as
                  "knowledge" differs from ours (cf. Descartes, 143).
                  What historical reasons help explain why it is this
                  way (cf. Bailey, 135-6)?</li>
                <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">Explain why
                  Descartes is certain he exists (third paragraph of M2,
                  146).<br>

                    does Descartes say a thinking thing is (beginning of

                <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">Explain why
                  proving God exists and is no deceiver would be an
                  appropriate strategy for getting rid of defective

                  could be done)? Why would it be better than the other
                  strategy we discussed in class? (We discussed both
                  practical and philosophical reasons why it would be

                <li>Explain how Descartes' standard for what counts as

                <li>Explain Locke's view (which Descartes shares, by the

                  explain what Locke thinks the senses are good for, and
                  what they are not good for (Locke, 186 &sect;8; cf.

                <li>Explain how R&eacute;e argues that our choices are
                  determined by his comparison of the stone, the donkey,
                  and us (417-9; class notes).<br>
                </li>
                <li>How does R&eacute;e argue that we are not

                  notes)?<br>
                </li>
                <li>Explain how R&eacute;e and Eagleman account for our
                  belief that we have free will (R&eacute;e's section 4,
                  pp. 422-5; Eagleman, 3-5). (It may be helpful to
                  discuss Eagleman's "stowaway" or "newspaper"

                    to Campbell, three conditions must be met to have
                    free will and be morally responsible. What are they
                    (Campbell, section 2, 545-7)?</span> [sorry, that
                  one was a mistake, forget about it]<br>
                </li>
                <li>Which of our choices does Campbell say are free (and
                  for which we may be responsible) (550, end of section
                  5)? Give an example of a free choice, and explain why
                  it's an example.<br>
                </li>
                <li>How does Campbell argue that introspection is good
                  evidence of free will (Campbell, 550)? Why is this
                  really not very strong evidence (Campbell, 550; class
                  notes)?<br>
                </li>
                <li>Explain how a determinist could argue that our
                  predictability shows that we do not have free will
                  (Campbell, section 9, 552). Then, explain Campbell's
                  replies to this argument (552-3; class notes).</li>
                <li>Explain why Ayer is unsure whether determinism is
                  true (439-40). If determinism is false, and our
                  choices are undetermined, does Ayer think we would
                  then be responsible for our choices? How come (440)?<br>
                </li>
                <li>How does Ayer try to show we can be responsible even
                  if we are determined? Specifically, when does Ayer
                  think we are "free" and responsible, and when does he
                  think we are not? (To do this well, you will need to
                  explain Ayer's definition of freedom, his criterion
                  for responsibility, and what he thinks constraints
                  are, 441-2.)<br>

                <li>Explain why Taylor thinks the glow worms' lives are
