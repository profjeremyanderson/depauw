                  Those who watched Marie Elise West's manic spiral saw
                  a collision coming. But under existing California law,
                  there was little they could do to stop it. <br>
                  &nbsp; </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">By
                  PAUL TEETOR, Special To The Times </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Al
                  Bowman knew the answer, but he still had to ask.
                  "Honey, why don't you skip your shift tonight and
                  check in at Harbor-UCLA? Maybe you could use a little
                  help." He phrased it as a gentle suggestion to his
                  wife, but her blazing blue eyes scorched him from
                  across the room. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"I'm

                  not going to get strapped down and get a needle stuck
                  in me," he remembers her saying. "I'm fine. I'm going
                  to work." </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">It
                  was Aug. 31, 2000, the Thursday night before Labor
                  Day, and Hermosa Beach was getting ready to do what it
                  does best: paaaarrrtty. But the 41-year-old Bowman had
                  no time for barbecues and block parties, no time for
                  the skin-on-skates fashion show rolling down the
                  Strand or the Fiesta de las Artes that turns the Pier
                  Plaza into a sprawling, smoky street fair. His wife,
                  35-year-old Marie Elise West, was showing signs of
                  another manic episode like the one she had experienced
                  five months earlier, in March 2000, when she was
                  arrested for trespassing at a Redondo Beach hotel
                  called the Palos Verdes Inn. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">She
                  had been hospitalized for 45 days after that arrest,
                  her sixth arrest and 19th hospitalization since 1990,
                  when she was diagnosed with manic-depression, also
                  known as bipolar disorder. During the depression
                  phase, she often slept as many as 18 hours a day. But
                  she had slept little during the previous few days. At
                  dinner with a friend the night before, Bowman says,
                  she spoke in the voices of three different
                  personalities: an Army drill sergeant, a college
                  professor and a street-walking prostitute. Then she
                  was involved in a late-night car accident. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Now
                  she couldn't stop buzzing around the little Cape
                  Cod-style bungalow they shared with their three
                  Chihuahuas five blocks from the beach. West's manic
                  episodes usually came in the spring or early fall, but
                  clearly she was close to the edge on that late summer
                  day. Bowman says he paced the floor in frustration
                  after she rejected his plea to check in at a hospital.
                  Under the 33-year-old state law known as the
                  Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, mentally ill people in
                  California can be held against their will only if they
                  are deemed a danger to themselves or others, or
                  gravely disabled. Typically, police are called during
                  a violent episode and they "5150" the patient to a
                  hospital--a reference to a section of the LPS Act that
                  allows police to transport someone to a hospital,
                  where they can be held for evaluation for 72 hours.
                  Otherwise, people showing signs of a psychotic episode
                  must sign themselves in voluntarily to receive
                  emergency medical treatment. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">With

                  West's mania and its surge of inflated self-confidence
                  coming on, Bowman knew there was no chance his wife
                  would sign herself in that night. A onetime law
                  student, she knew all the angles of California's
                  mental-health laws. He had called the police under
                  similar circumstances in March, to no avail. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The
                  police officers who came to the house that March night
                  determined that West was not violent, and they made
                  Bowman give her the car keys she was demanding. Sgt.
                  Paul Wolcott of the Hermosa Beach Police, who once
                  before had 5150'd West, says of the March episode:
                  "She wasn't violent, and the car was registered to
                  her, so we had no choice. The law gives us very
                  narrow, very strict guidelines to work under. If she
                  doesn't meet the 5150 guidelines, there's not much we
                  can do." </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Bowman

                  had already called one of her psychiatrists, Dwight
                  Bergquist, and advised him of the situation a few days
                  before. Bergquist had not seen West in several weeks,
                  but Bowman says the psychiatrist advised him to adjust
                  her medication, which he did, adding Haldol to the
                  four medications--prescribed by different
                  doctors--that she already was taking. Bergquist says
                  he advised Bowman to take her to a hospital, but
                  Bowman did not. What was the point, he says, if she
                  wasn't going to sign herself in? </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The
                  mental-health movement known as mainstreaming,
                  designed to get mental patients out of hospitals and
                  into the community, has had a number of unintended
                  consequences, many of them positive, some of them
                  deadly. One of every 20 homicides in this country is
                  committed by untreated or under-treated mentally ill
                  people, according to a 1994 report by the U.S. Justice
                  Department. A recent study by the John D. and
                  Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, an Illinois-based
                  philanthropic group, estimates that mental patients
                  released into their communities commit nearly 1,000
                  homicides each year. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Proponents


                  hailed the mainstreaming movement in the 1970s as part
                  of the civil-rights struggle. Critics warned the
                  impact of the movement on society could be dangerous,
                  but they were brushed aside by an unlikely alliance of
                  politicians--including then-California Gov. Ronald
                  Reagan, who saw mainstreaming as a way to empty
                  overcrowded treatment facilities and cut state
                  costs--and civil-rights leaders, who cited horror
                  stories of people held against their will after they
                  were no longer a threat to anyone. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Thirty

                  years later, the story of Marie Elise West highlights
                  one of the unintended consequences of that dramatic
                  policy shift. It also raises disturbing questions
                  about whether California's mental-health laws are
                  outdated. Have the civil rights of the mentally ill
                  taken priority over public safety? Has the basic right
                  to walk the streets safely been compromised by state
                  government's unwillingness to legislate--and pay
                  for--treatment of the mentally ill? </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"We've

                  been aware that the pendulum had swung too far for
                  quite a while now," says Assemblywoman Helen Thomson,
                  D-Davis, a leader in the movement to reform the state
                  mental-health laws. "It's sad because 99% of the
                  mentally ill are not involved in violent incidents,
                  but the focus is on the 1% who do commit these violent
                  acts because the headlines are so startling to the
                  community." </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The
                  warning signs of problems with the new mainstreaming
                  policy cropped up early. Within the first five years
                  after the LPS Act took effect Jan. 1, 1969, the number
                  of mentally ill people who committed crimes and were
                  imprisoned in state or county jails jumped 300%.
                  Although the LPS Act has been amended during the
                  ensuing 30 years, it continues to guide California's
                  approach to the tricky intersection of the criminal
                  justice system, which is based on a culture of
                  punishment, and the mental-health system, which is
                  based on a culture of treatment. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Thomson,

                  who began working as a psychiatric nurse in 1963,
                  asked for a report on the criminalization of the
                  mentally ill in 1997. That report found that 20% of
                  the state prison population and 11% of the county jail
                  population are severely mentally ill. In its final
                  report, issued in 1999, an LPS Reform Task Force--an
                  ad hoc advocacy group made up mostly of mental-health
                  professionals and affected families--concluded that
                  the original law underestimated "the structure and
                  support some people with mental illness would require
                  to successfully participate in community life." Even
                  with piecemeal amendments, it described the law as
                  "one of the most adversarial, costly and difficult to
                  administer involuntary treatment systems in the U.S."
                </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The
                  report added to a growing call for reform, but major
                  changes in the LPS Act proved elusive until a spate of
                  high-profile automobile homicides involving mentally
                  ill people made the issue a legislative priority. In
                  1999, an Orange County man with a history of mental
                  problems drove into an Irvine schoolyard and killed
                  two children. Last year four people died during an
                  Isla Vista street party when a UC Santa Barbara
                  student with a history of mental problems drove his
                  car into a crowd. Several cases involved affluent
                  mentally ill people, reminding legislators that mental
                  illness is not just a problem among the homeless and
                  disenfranchised. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The
                  basic issue--when and how someone should be
                  involuntarily treated--remains the same. "It's not
                  only morally and legally wrong to allow these people
                  to go without care until they do something criminal,
                  it's also financially wrong," says Carl A. "Tony"
                  Capozzola, a defense attorney representing West in the
                  case stemming from the tragic consequences of that
                  late August night. "It costs taxpayers more in police,
                  legal and incarceration costs than it ever would to
                  treat them properly." </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">West

                  dressed for her shift as a server at the Hermosa
                  Steakout restaurant in an outfit that showed off her
                  blond hair and compact dancer's body. Barely 5 feet 6
                  in heels, she was a high-energy dancer who had worked
                  as a Vegas showgirl in 1991 and 1992. For a moment
                  Bowman remembered why he had stood by her, unlike two
                  previous husbands who had bailed out when they
                  realized this sexy, smack-talking beach babe was also
                  mentally ill. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">After

                  she left for work, Bowman called her parents, Roger
                  and Geraldine West of Seal Beach, at 7:30 p.m. He
                  conferred with them, as he often had since he met West
                  in 1995 and married her in 1999. The relationship with
                  his in-laws had been rocky from the start. For five
                  years, they were reluctant caregivers, each blaming
                  the other for her occasional flights into mania.
                  Bowman felt that any contact with her parents was
                  stressful for her. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Her
                  parents felt that Bowman's lifestyle as producer of
                  the Los Angeles Music Awards--which Bowman says
                  includes late-night clubbing, loud music and 24/7
                  phone calls--was a catalyst for her manic episodes.
                  But this night, after nearly an hour of discussion,
                  they agreed on a plan that ultimately would be doomed
                  by apparent miscommunication. Roger West and his son
                  Allen, an attorney who had represented Marie Elise
                  during many previous episodes, intended to come over
                  to take her to the hospital, then to ask the hospital
                  police to 5150 her. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">At
                  the restaurant, West was so exuberant she started
                  inviting people in off the street and urging them to
                  order dinner and put it on her credit card. At 9 p.m.,
                  two hours before her usual quitting time, her
                  supervisor ordered her to go home. When she arrived,
                  Bowman was convinced a manic phase was beginning, and
                  that it likely would lead to an incident that would
                  keep her hospitalized anywhere from two days to four
                  weeks. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">At
                  10:30 p.m., West began to fear for someone else's
                  safety, another signal that she was spiraling into a
                  manic phase. In 1993 she had driven her car into the
                  Huntington Beach Pier because she thought Nazis were
                  gassing Jews underneath it, and in 1995 she had
                  attacked a teacher at an elementary school after she
                  walked on the school grounds, announced she was the
                  Messiah and warned students they would be sold into
                  sexual slavery. Now she began to obsess that Michael
                  Maglieri, son of Mario Maglieri, owner of the Sunset
                  Strip clubs The Whisky, The Roxy and the Rainbow Bar
                  &amp; Grill, would be killed by gang members. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Bowman

                  hid West's car keys when she went into the bedroom to
                  change into black jeans and a black shirt, but he was
                  no match for her guile as the mania took over. A
                  minute later she came flying out with a "secret" set
                  of keys to her 1989 green Volvo 240DL and said she was
                  going to rescue Maglieri. She began screaming and ran
                  outside, drawing the attention of neighbors. Once
                  before, Bowman had been issued a domestic-abuse
                  warning when he says he was merely trying to get
                  assistance for her. He feared another such police
                  misunderstanding, so he stood and watched as she drove
                  away at 11:30 p.m. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Bowman

                  called her parents again and swore that he would take
                  her to the hospital himself--against her will--as soon
                  as she returned and ask the hospital police to 5150
                  her. Then he called Hermosa police and warned them she
                  was loose. They promised to look for her. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">At
                  1 a.m., West called from the Rainbow Bar &amp; Grill.
                  Bowman begged her to come home but she ranted about
                  land mines on the 405 Freeway and hung up. He walked
                  the floor all night and called police twice more.
                  Nothing. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">At
                  3:45 a.m., as Bowman was still pacing in Hermosa
                  Beach, Jesus Plascencia pulled his old, cranberry-red
                  Buick into the parking lot of the Western Bagel Shop
                  in Van Nuys. It was the same routine the 65-year-old
                  Mexican immigrant had performed six days a week for
                  the last 12 years: pick up several dozen bagels and
                  bring them to nearby Weiler's Deli, where he worked as
                  a busboy. A frail, gentle man at 5 feet 9 and 140
                  pounds, Plascencia spoke little and communicated
                  mostly through his hands. As he walked into the bagel
                  store, he passed a green Volvo parked in a no-parking
                  zone with a blond woman fidgeting behind the wheel. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">When


                  Plascencia came out with his bagels and approached his
                  car, police say West suddenly put her car in reverse,
                  backed up and hit him. The blow knocked him to his
                  knees as dozens of bagels and his black baseball cap
                  scattered onto the oil-stained parking lot. His shirt
                  caught on the undercarriage and he was dragged 30
                  yards onto Sepulveda Boulevard, where he rolled free.
                  Although no one knows if she did so deliberately,
                  police say West stopped the car, turned around, and
                  ran over him again, once more snagging his shirt and
                  dragging him farther down the road until he rolled
                  free again. She left him dead in the street, police
                  say. She drove back into the parking lot, went in the
                  bagel shop and asked employee Hector Quintero for a
                  cup of water. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">When

                  Quintero confronted West about Plascencia, she
                  replied: "Oh, him? He's roadkill." Quintero called
                  911. West grabbed the cup of water and stormed out to
                  the parking lot, where she wandered aimlessly for a
                  few minutes. One witness said West looked like a
                  "stripper" in her black blouse and tight black pants.
                  Then she picked up a few of the fallen bagels and put
                  them in the trunk of her car before being confronted
                  by a firefighter. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"You're

                  not a police officer," she said. "I don't have to
                  answer your questions." As other firefighters
                  surrounded her, West got in her car, locked the doors,
                  rolled up the windows, turned up the volume and put on
                  a favorite CD. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Firefighters


                  from L.A. Station 90 in Van Nuys were on the scene
                  within five minutes of the dispatcher's report of a
                  car-pedestrian accident at Western Bagel. After
                  several firefighters surrounded the Volvo, West rolled
                  down her front passenger window. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"What

                  do you want? All I did was stop and try to get some
                  water because my radiator is overheating," she said.
                  She rolled up the window again, turned the volume all
                  the way up and ignored them. Finally, Capt. Corey Rose
                  took a ball-peen hammer and broke the Volvo's left
                  rear window. West kicked and cursed as she was dragged
                  out of the car. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"You

                  people don't run this country, you're just servants,"
                  she said. "Wait till my ex-husband hears of this. He's
                  a big man, and, yes, he is black." </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Police

                  took West to the Van Nuys division of the Los Angeles
                  Police Department. As she was brought in for booking,
                  Det. Al Aldaz says, West made anti-Latino slurs and
                  kicked at the officers escorting her. The first TV
                  reporters arrived at Western Bagel minutes after
                  police took West away. Within hours, Aldaz made the
                  first of several public statements suggesting the
                  homicide was a hate crime. He told the media: "She
                  said something about people of Hispanic descent should
                  go back to their country, after the intentional
                  hitting of the vehicle toward the victim." He also
                  told reporters that West said "she hated people of
                  Hispanic descent." </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">At
                  5 p.m. Friday, a reporter for WABC/7 news delivered a
                  report that was typical of the early TV coverage:
                  "This was no accident here this morning," he began.
                  "Police have arrested 35-year-old Marie West of
                  Redondo Beach [sic] and charged her with murder, and
                  they do say it was a hate crime. They say she
                  intentionally ran down a Hispanic man simply because
                  he was Hispanic." </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">After

                  showing footage of the crime scene, the reporter
                  concluded: "L.A. police say they see no indication
                  that Marie Elise West is crazy. They say the first
                  thing she did when she got to the police station was
                  ask for a lawyer." </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The
                  hate-crime angle continued to build in the media echo
                  chamber over the weekend as details emerged.
                  Plascencia had never married, but he had worked at the
                  deli for more than 20 years and he lived with a family
                  that took him in as their honorary grandfather. He was
                  known and beloved by his friends and co-workers as a
                  humble, hard-working man. They gathered 2,000
                  signatures on a petition demanding that West be
                  charged with a hate-crime murder. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">To
                  convict West of a hate-crime murder, the state would
                  have to prove that she intentionally killed Plascencia
                  because of his ethnicity. Such a charge also would
                  make her eligible for the death penalty or life
                  imprisonment without the possibility of parole,
                  depending on how the district attorney decided to
                  pursue it. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">On
                  the morning of Sept. 5, four days after the homicide,
                  Gil Garcetti, then the L.A. County district attorney,
                  charged West with a hate-crime murder, alleging that
                  she killed Plascencia in a premeditated act because he
                  was Latino. Capozzola, West's attorney, says he asked
                  Jacquelyn Lacey, head of the D.A.'s hate-crime unit,
                  to hold off on the charge until West's mental state
                  could be evaluated. He says he was told the decision
                  had already been made and that the complaint could be
                  amended later if it turned out a hate-crime charge was
                  not warranted. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"I
                  told her it was premature and not consistent with a
                  careful evaluation of the facts," says Capozzola, a
                  former deputy district attorney. "Why was there such a
                  rush to judgment?" </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">West's


                  parents suspect that Garcetti--who declined several
                  interview requests for this story--was trying to curry
                  favor with the Valley's Latino voters as part of his
                  losing bid for reelection two months later. Bowman
                  tried to fight back on local newscasts, arguing that
                  West was out of her mind on a toxic cocktail of
                  medications at the time of the homicide and, in her
                  right mind, would never harbor any racist thoughts.
                  Three weeks after Plascencia's death, a judge in Van
                  Nuys Superior Court referred West's case to a
                  mental-health court, which determined that West was
                  not competent and should be held for treatment and
                  evaluation until she is competent to stand trial. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Chuck

                  Jones, Western Bagel's human resources director, was
                  at the scene the morning Plascencia was killed . He
                  says he is surprised that D.A. Steve Cooley--who
                  defeated Garcetti--still has not dismissed the
                  hate-crime charge. He said all the employees he talked
                  to that morning understood instinctively that West was
                  mentally ill. "Several of the workers said she was
                  crazy. It's unfortunate the police turned it into a
                  hate crime so quickly," Jones says. "It had nothing to
                  do with [Plascencia] being Latino--unless there's
                  something we don't know about in her background." </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">West

                  had grown up assuming she was white, but in 1978 she
                  learned that her mother was officially "racially
                  mixed" because of her Creole background. That was when
                  the West family first learned that her mother,
                  Geraldine Porche, had ancestors in Louisiana that
                  included black slaves who had borne the children of
                  white French settlers. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">In
                  the summer of 1990, West completed an internship at
                  the Bet Tzedek Legal Services firm, where she told
                  everyone she was headed to Berkeley's Boalt Hall law
                  school. In her exit review, dated Aug. 13, 1990, her
                  supervisor described the 25-year-old West as a "legal
                  assistant extraordinaire." </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The
                  flattering description was supported by detailed
                  insights: "Marie Elise is an extremely intelligent
                  woman. She has excellent oral and written
                  communication skills. . . . She is highly organized."
                  On her application to Boalt Hall, West checked off
                  "racially mixed," a factor that could have helped her
                  gain admission after graduating from UCLA in 1988 with
                  a bachelor's degree in history and a 3.2 grade-point
                  average. She delayed starting law school for two
                  years. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">By
                  the time she arrived at Boalt Hall, West had begun to
                  wonder if she had been admitted because of affirmative
                  action policies. She decided she would leave law
                  school if she had. "She felt she would have been
                  depriving someone who had suffered true discrimination
                  of the extra help they were entitled to," Bowman says.
                </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">West

                  checked with the admissions director, who told her,
                  informally, that affirmative action had not been a
                  factor. Two days later West tried to join the Black
                  Student Union. Her lead attorney, Capozzola, did not
                  allow her to be interviewed for this article. But
                  according to Bowman, West claims she was ridiculed by
                  some of the black students, who may have felt the
                  blond-haired, blue-eyed West was mocking them. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">On
                  Sept. 9, 1990, two weeks after she arrived at law
                  school, West told her roommate that CIA spies were
                  following her. Someone called police after seeing her
                  behave erratically at a mass-transit station, and
                  police took her to the Herrick campus of Alta Bates
                  Medical Center, where she was first diagnosed with the
                  onset of bipolar syndrome. She stayed for more than a
                  week, then she checked out and resumed classes. But
                  after two more weeks of classes, West voluntarily
                  returned to Alta Bates. She checked out in mid-October
                  and came home to Seal Beach. Four days later, a very
                  troubled West was admitted to College Hospital in
                  Cerritos. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Her
                  "chief complaint" on her admission form, as quoted by
                  the attending physician, Charles Clegg: "There is too
                  much--too much--the pressure of law school is too
                  much." It became clear to West's College Hospital
                  doctors that there were other problems--family and
                  racial issues--that may have played as much a part in
                  her initial breakdown as those first weeks of law
                  school. She said she was hearing voices that
                  frightened her, and ascribed racial overtones to her
                  emerging mental problems. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">According

                  to Clegg's notes of Nov. 3, 1990: "She stated the
                  voices told her they knew she was mentally ill. She
                  stated she thought these voices were people from the
                  black student union she had joined at Berkeley. She
                  stated she was extremely fearful of these voices. She
                  stated she was a Creole and that had made her black.
                  In fact the patient is Caucasian. . . . Her initial
                  mental status examination showed her to be totally
                  overwhelmed. Flight of ideas and tangentiality were
                  obvious. . . . She was clearly hypomanic and did not
                  appear to realize that she was mentally ill." </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Clegg

                  had identified a critical problem for West and many
                  mental patients: the inability to realize they are ill
                  and need medication. Her parents, Geraldine and Roger
                  West, have joined several organizations for families
                  of the mentally ill. They say they have seen and heard
                  about the denial syndrome many times. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">During

                  an interview at their Seal Beach duplex, Roger, a
                  retired computer salesman, reaches into his shirt
                  pocket and pulls out a 3-by-5-inch notecard. In
                  capital letters, he carefully prints the word
                  "ANOSOGNOSIA"--defined as a patient's inability to
                  recognize his or her own disorder or illness. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"It's

                  the key to understanding all this," he says as he
                  hands the card over. Even though they don't get along,
                  Bowman agrees with his father-in-law on this point.
                  "It's the Catch-22 that the authors of the LPS Act
                  didn't take into account," he says. "Medication works,
                  but only if the patient is conscientious about taking
                  [it]. When the mania comes on, they start to feel so
                  good that the idea there might be something wrong with
                  them is absurd. So they no longer feel the need for
                  medication, and that's when the public is endangered."
                </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">J.
                  Raymond DePaulo, a specialist in manic-depression at
                  Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, says it is
                  crucial for a patient to establish a stable, long-term
                  relationship with a hospital and a therapist. Ideally,
                  outpatient care of medication and therapy is
                  supplemented with brief hospitalizations when
                  necessary. More than 75% of America's 3 million
                  manic-depressive patients manage to live fairly stable
                  lives, he says, even though most are not correctly
                  diagnosed until 10 years after the onset. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">West's


                  medical records, provided by Bowman, are littered with
                  references to her resistance to medication. She
                  complained constantly that the medications were
                  fueling her descent into mental illness. Within two
                  months of her initial episode, the pattern for the
                  next decade was set: West--often convinced that she
                  was not sick--began a modern odyssey of 19
                  hospitalizations that would lead her to eight
                  hospitals, seven therapists and an ever-growing list
                  of medications, including the mood-stabilizing drug
                  lithium and the powerful psychotropics Haldol and
                  Seroquel. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"That

                  happens all too often," DePaulo says. "Her case is not
                  unique. The cohesive support network often just isn't
                  there." </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Money

                  for medication, therapy and hospitalization quickly
                  became an issue. West's parents went through more than
                  $125,000 helping her during the first few years after
                  diagnosis, until a monthly bill of $951 for medication
                  finally forced them to look for help from Medi-Cal.
                  West was granted Social Security disability payments
                  in December 1995, but that did not cover all the
                  medical costs. Money was always a stress point for
                  her. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">West's


                  parents say California's outdated, inadequate laws
                  force families--even relatively affluent families
                  determined to stay involved with their mentally ill
                  children--to watch helplessly as their loved ones try
                  to live independently until their next episode, when
                  they again can be hospitalized against their will.
                  That leads to fragmented treatment, they say. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"The

                  reality is that when someone is 5150'd, the police
                  take him or her to the nearest institution equipped to
                  handle them. That's how she started at Alta Bates and
                  Harbor-UCLA," says Geraldine West, a retired
                  paralegal. She noted, too, that her daughter was
                  5150'd eight times before she ran down Jesus
                  Plascencia. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">During

                  the decade that passed between Sept. 9, 1990, the day
                  of West's first psychotic episode, and Sept. 1, 2000,
                  the day she killed Plascencia, West had struggled to
                  live as a "normal" person, to prove to everyone how
                  smart and involved she was. She tried law school three
                  more times, and three more times she quickly had
                  psychotic episodes and dropped out. She also worked as
                  a legal assistant, as a Las Vegas showgirl and as a
                  cosmetics saleswoman. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">She
                  joined health clubs and the Sierra Club, volunteered
                  for the ACLU and wrote songs. She tried to start a
                  bumper sticker business with her own heartfelt
                  messages ("Immigrants Are People Too," and "Why Do We
                  Kill People to Show Them That Killing People Is
                  Wrong?") and wrote hundreds of letters offering advice
                  to politicians such as former President Bill Clinton
                  and U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein. She took up the causes
                  of everyone from inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal to publisher
                  Larry Flynt. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">She
                  married three times, once to a black man and the third
                  time to Bowman, who is half-Latino. Bowman did not
                  realize she was mentally ill until several months
                  after they began dating, when he woke up to find her
                  burning his Beatles albums and screaming, "These are
                  not the Beatles. They're impostors from the CIA."
                  Bowman called her parents in the morning and learned
                  he was in love with a mentally ill woman. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"Up
                  till then I just thought she was a beautiful, kind,
                  idealistic girl who had a really outgoing
                  personality," he says. "By the time of the first
                  episode, I was in love, and I couldn't leave her." </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Typical

                  of West's efforts during the five years Bowman lived
                  with her was a letter she wrote to film director
                  Steven Spielberg on June 7, 1997. "I recently saw your
                  latest movie, 'The Lost World.' I was shocked and
                  delighted to see a young girl of color play a role in
                  your film that would have normally gone to a
                  Caucasian. . . . I am very sensitive to race issues
                  for reasons unknown to myself." </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The
                  letter shows why the hate-crime charge is so absurd,
                  Bowman says, and so painful for West's friends and
                  family. "She celebrated her own ethnicity," he says.
                  "This had nothing to do with hate. She couldn't
                  control the illness. It controlled her. Because the
                  law wouldn't let us hold her against her will when the
                  illness took over, Mr. Plascencia is dead and my wife
                  is facing the death penalty." </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">West's

                  case has been stalled for the past 20 months as she
                  goes through her prison-style daily routine of
                  evaluation and treatment. Currently taking five
                  different medications, she remains at Patton State
                  Hospital, waiting to be declared competent to stand
                  trial. She was found incompetent again last month, and
                  her next hearing is scheduled for Oct. 8. If West is
                  found competent, both sides agree a trial could follow
                  soon after--unless a deal is struck. The fundamental
                  questions posed by the hate-crime charge remain: Did
                  West kill Plascencia deliberately? Did she kill him
                  because he was Latino, or because she was out of her
                  mind and would have backed into whoever was there? </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Bowman

                  says his wife should be charged only with involuntary
                  vehicular manslaughter. "This was a terrible accident
                  by a woman having a psychotic episode, a woman who
                  tried desperately to stay on the right mix of
                  medication. Mr. Garcetti tried to pump it up into a
                  hate crime for his own political purposes," he says.
                  "It was a politically motivated rush to judgment."
                  While Deputy D.A. Scott Millington, who took over the
                  case and now is head of the D.A.'s hate-crime unit,
                  and Det. Aldaz say they still believe this was a hate
                  crime, Plascencia's nephew, Sal Hernandez, says he is
                  not sure. "I don't know why she did it," he says. "The
                  reason will probably never be known." </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Hernandez,


                  who works as a mechanical engineer in Los Angeles,
                  says he does not want to see West on death row. "But
                  she deserves to be put away from society, so she will
                  not commit a similar act," he says. "She was
                  responsible for maintaining her medication. This is
                  what society demands of all of us." </p>

                  alone at night with his three dogs, estranged now from
                  West's family, notorious in the town he was raised in
                  as the husband of the crazy woman who ran down a
                  kindly old immigrant, Bowman says he relates to the
                  plight of Rusty Yates, husband of the Texas woman
                  convicted of drowning her five children in the family
                  tub. "Sometimes I feel like the only man in America
                  who can relate to what he has had to endure, when you
                  love someone who turns out to be mentally ill," Bowman
                  says. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">He
                  says he is haunted by memories and second-guesses.
                  Suspecting the approach of another manic episode, he
                  says he talked things over with a still-rational West
                  a week before Plascencia's death. He says she told him
                  she wanted to be treated at Alta Bates Medical Center
                  in Berkeley, where she was brought after her first
                  episode back in 1990. "She always felt they did the
                  best job with her," Bowman says. He also says she
                  wanted to go alone, insisting, "I don't need a
                  babysitter." </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">So
                  he bought her a plane ticket for San Francisco,
                  arranged for her to stay with friends and took her to
                  the airport on Aug. 27. That same day workers began a
                  long-planned refurbishing of their house. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">When

                  West arrived at Alta Bates the next day, she told the
                  admitting doctor she was having gynecological
                  problems, not mental problems. "I think that, like
                  many mental patients, she just chickened out from
                  admitting herself to the psych ward. No one likes to
                  get strapped down or get a needle stuck in them,"
                  Bowman says. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The
                  doctor prescribed an anti-bleeding medication and
                  released West without any mental evaluation. She flew
                  home Aug. 29, took a taxi from the airport and showed
                  up at the house unannounced. She found the carpet
                  pulled up and the furniture removed, and Bowman says
                  his wife began crying hysterically. </p>
                <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"Any

                  kind of stress like that, any change in her
                  environment, could set her off," he says. "I knew she
                  was on the edge, but I felt helpless. There was
                  nothing I could do. Not until she was violent. Not
                  until it was too late." </p>
