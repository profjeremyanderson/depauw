            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">1. In class
                we listed many reasons why you should, or should not,
                hook up with a stranger when your significant other is
                away. These reasons fell into three main groups. First,
                identify the groups. (Hint: remember what the reasons in
                each group had in common.) Which group was biggest?
                Which was smallest? For each group, identify one reason
                for or against hooking up in that group, and explain why
                that reason fits in that group. Finally, name the type
                of ethical theory which corresponds to each group.</font><font

                questions about the basis of moral rules. </font></h4>
            <font size="-1"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span></font>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">2. Cephalus
                believes that justice is being truthful and giving back
                what you have taken from another (Plato, 7). Why does
                Socrates reject this definition?<br>
                <br>
                3. In class we saw that when Socrates, Cephalus, and
                Polemarchus try to define justice (Plato, 2-8) they make
                some important assumptions about it. What were their
                assumptions about justice?<br>
                <br>
                4. Explain what Thrasymachus means when he says that
                &#8220;the just is nothing else than the advantage of the
                stronger&#8221; (Plato, 15; Phil 230, 2020-09-02). How does
                this challenge the others' assumptions about justice?<br>
                <br>
                5. Thrasymachus defends his moral skepticism by arguing
                that being just does not benefit you--rather, it is bad
                for you--and that "justice" is really just a sort of
                scam used to exploit the weak. How does he argue for
                this? In other words, what reasons does he give for his
                view (Plato, 16, 21-2)?<br>
                <br>
                6. Define these terms as they are used in this course:
                &#8220;moral skepticism,&#8221; &#8220;moral subjectivism,&#8221; &#8220;cultural
                relativism,&#8221; and &#8220;ethical objectivism&#8221; (Phil 230, </font><font
                size="-1">2020-09-04).<br>
                <br>
                7. Benedict describes two main kinds of cultural
                differences. One kind is where people we have labeled
                "abnormal" and unfit--such as those who are cataleptic
                or homosexual--have a respected (though not necessarily
                central) place in other societies (Benedict, 1-2).
                Explain one of Benedict's examples of that kind of
                difference.<br>
                <br>
                8. Benedict says, "The most spectacular illustrations of
                the extent to which normality may be culturally defined
                are those cultures where an abnormality of our culture
                is the cornerstone of their social structure" (3).
                First, explain what this sentence means. Then, pick one
                of the cultures she uses to illustrate this point, and
                explain how that culture's practices are supposed to
                provide evidence for Benedict's claim.<br>
                <br>
                9. How does Benedict use her examples of differences to
                support cultural relativism? In class, this was
                summarized in "Benedict's argument," so you could
                explain that argument. <br>
                <br>
                10. How does Rachels criticize the "Cultural Differences
                Argument" (Rachels, 3-4)? What problems for Rachels were
                discussed in class? (There were two.)<br>
                <br>
                11. How does Rachels argue that there is less
                disagreement about values between cultures than it seems
                (Rachels, 5-6)? Explain both the cows and Eskimos
                examples. <br>
                <br>
                12. Rachels says, &#8220;There are some moral rules that all
                societies must have in common, because those rules are
                necessary for society to exist&#8221; (7). How does he support
                this claim? <br>
                <br>
                13. According to Rachels, there is a culture-neutral
                standard for telling whether moral rules are justified
                (Rachels, 9). What is it? How does he argue for this? <br>
                <br>
                14. King lists negative experiences suffered by Black
                people (King, 14) and says they are unjust--that they
                are objectively wrong (16). What would a moral skeptic
                say about whether they are wrong? What would a moral
                subjectivist say? A cultural relativist? <br>
                <br>
                15. King says we should obey just laws but disobey
                unjust laws (15). How, according to King, can we
                objectively distinguish just laws from unjust laws
                (King, 15-20 but especially 16)?<br>
                <br>
                16. Benedict observes individual cultures and </font><font
                size="-1">finds a range of human traits and moral values</font><font
                size="-1">. How does Aquinas differ? (Class notes and
                the Aquinas explainer video will be helpful here.)<br>

                17. Aquinas argues for ethical objectivism by saying
                that human nature--specifically, our natural
                inclinations--provide an objective basis for judging
                human laws. What are the inclinations Aquinas identifies
                (<span style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>, 4-5)?
                What precepts of natural law does Aquinas derive from
                these inclinations? <br>
                <br>
                18. What does it mean to say that the precepts of
                natural law are <span style="font-style: italic;">vague</span>,
                and that they are <span style="font-style: italic;">authoritative</span>?
                What are the implications of them being vague, and being
                authoritative? (Class notes and the Aquinas explainer
                video will be helpful here.)<br>

                21. Glaucon and Socrates agree there are three ways
                something can be good (Plato, 35-6). Explain what each
                is, and give two examples of each. (You may use examples
                from the book or class discussion, but you will get more

                22. Glaucon describes "what justice is and where it came
                from" (Plato, 36-7). What four claims about human nature
                does he make there (or, rather, what four claims does he
                think "the many" believe)?<br>
                <br>
                23. Suppose Glaucon's four claims about human nature are
                true. What, then, does Glaucon think we should do
                (Plato, 37)? What, then, is Glaucon implying about us

                24. In class we discussed what people would do if they
                had a ring that would enable them to do as they please.
                What were the results--would people generally behave
                justly or not? How does that relate to Glaucon's claims

                27. Explain why utilitarianism has the "accounting
                problem" we discussed in class. How does Bentham respond
                to the problem? (Bentham, section VI on p. 4.) <br>

                to ask, "How do Bentham and Mill respond to the

                the parameters he mentions (121). (Well, you don't have
                to use all--let's say, use four of them). Which of your

                is the "swine problem" (Mill, 1)? Mill responds to the
                swine problem in two ways; explain both of them. In
                doing so, be sure to answer the following questions.
                What pleasures does Mill say that only humans can enjoy
                (Mill, 1)? How does he argue that we value them much
                more highly (Mill, 2)? What does Mill say are the causes
                of unhappiness in those who are well off, and those who
                are not (Mill, 4)? How does Mill think a life of
                self-development and service alleviates unhappiness for
                all (Mill, 4-5)?<br>

                31. Mill has two responses to the "accounting problem"
                (Mill, 5-6). Explain each one. In doing so, be sure to
                answer the following questions. How does Mill argue that
                some people have more responsibility than others (Mill,
                5)? (In class this was compared to the Spider-Man Rule.)
                How does Mill argue that, really, we do not need to stop
                and calculate the effects of our actions before we can
                act (Mill, 6)? <br>

                32. Nozick gives three reasons why we would not plug in

                33. What is the Experience Machine Argument? (See the

                sure to make clear how the argument is supposed to show

                <br>
                34. Explain why utilitarianism would imply that, in Le

                35. What is the "moral conservative" argument against
                consequentialism (Nielsen, 219; class notes)? What is
                Nielsen's strategy for countering this objection? <br>

                <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">36. </span>Moral

                conservatives have used magistrate-type cases to argue
                that consequentialism should be rejected because it
                requires deliberately harming the innocent. How does
                Nielsen argue that moral conservatives need not reject
                consequentialism for how it deals with the magistrate
                case (223-5)? (Be sure to discuss what he says could
                happen if word gets out, 224.) How satisfactory is
                Nielsen's argument here? Give the strongest reasons you

                <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">37. </span>Nielsen





















                says consequentialism may clearly require harming the
                innocent sometimes--for example, in the case of the fat
                man stuck in the cave mouth (Nielsen,&nbsp; 222). How
                does he argue that this is the right thing to do here
                (228-30)? (Your answer will be better if you include how
                Nielsen responds to concerns about callousness, using
                the fat man as a means, and inhumanity, 228-30.) How
                satisfactory is his argument regarding this case? Give
                the strongest reasons you can to agree with you.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Advice: </span>some
                exam questions ask you to give your opinion and your
                reasons for it (like #36 and 37). The best strategy is
                to--first, before giving your opinion--explain what the
                author says in as much detail as you can. That will give
                you things to think critically about: you might agree
                with part of it, and disagree with another part, for
                example. Second, when giving your opinion, it's better
                to give <span style="font-style: italic;">independent </span>reasons;





















                don't just echo the author's own reasons. For example,
                saying "I agree with Nielsen in the fat man case because
                blowing the fat man up is the lesser evil" does not show
                much thought on your part. If that's all you can say,
                you should answer a different question. <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                38. Define the following terms as they are used in this
                course: &#8220;act utilitarianism,&#8221; &#8220;rule utilitarianism&#8221;
                (Hospers, 10; class notes).<br>
                <br>
                39. Hospers presents several cases at the beginning of
                his article: a student seeking an undeserved grade; a
                thief seeking to be released; a district attorney
                considering whether to keep an innocent man in jail; and
                voting (Hospers, 1-2, 4). Pick one of these cases, and
                explain why act-utilitarianism would recommend one
                choice while rule-utilitarianism would recommend a
                different choice.<br>

                your answer will involve the notions that Williams

                <br>
                Kant says this about the nature of moral laws and the

                  is to be valid as a ground of obligation, then it must
                  carry with it absolute necessity. He must admit that

                  for men, as if other rational beings had no need to
                  abide by it, and so with all the other moral laws
                  properly so called. And he must concede that the
                  ground of obligation here must therefore be sought not
