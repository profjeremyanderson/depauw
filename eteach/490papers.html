              <li><font size="-1">Your paper must be primarily
                  argumentative. That is, it must defend a conclusion
                  which other smart people might well disagree with, and
                  this must be your paper's major focus. There should be
                  no more background material than is necessary to
                  explain and give perspective to the arguments you
                  present.<br>
                  <br>
                </font></li>
              <li><font size="-1">To take a stand effectively, your
                  paper must be critical but fair to any opposition, and
                  your papers' conclusions should not depend on mere
                  expressions of personal opinion or armchair arguments.
                  It is not enough to explain why you think something is
                  so; you must strive to convince a reasonable reader
                  that any right-thinking person should agree with you.<br>

                </font></li>
              <li><font size="-1">Your paper must be submitted as a Word
                  (.docx or .doc) or Rich Text Format (.rtf) file. It
                  must be double spaced, have one-inch margins and
                  numbered pages, use 12-point Times New Roman or
                  similar font, and be free of mechanical errors
                  (grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc.). Your
                  computer's grammar- and spell-checking features are
                  not adequate; you will have to proofread your paper
                  yourself. Include a word count for the body of the
                  paper (that is, not including your name, end- or
                  footnotes, bibliography, etc.) at the top with your
                  identifying information.</font><font size="-1"> <br>

                  I am much more impressed by writers who express ideas

                    recommend you only use material from an AI when you
                    can verify it is accurate, or as an example you
                    critically evaluate. (Which, in practice, may mean

                    practicing skills in reading, critical thinking, and
                    writing are among the most important benefits of a
                    liberal arts education. Those skills matter at least
                    as much as whatever facts you learn because they are
                    fundamental to interacting intelligently with the
                    world. Without them, you cannot even assess whether

                use any AI in any way you must document how you used it
                by showing your prompts and AI's responses. (Screenshots
                are good for this.) Any use of AI that you fail to
                document is a form of plagiarism and may be charged as
                such.<br>
                <br>

                    AI (whether it's just a turn of phrase or something
                    more), put it in quotation marks and cite the AI.</font></li>
                <li><font size="-1">If you use anything (such as an
                    idea, or an example) you got from an AI without
                    copying the words, still cite the AI.</font></li>
                <li><font size="-1">If you use an AI to correct your
                    grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc., or to help

              </ul>
              <font style="font-family: Georgia;" size="-1"> In short,

                way whatsoever (wording, ideas, examples, arguments,
                grammar, punctuation, organization, etc.), document it.
                And, of course, the more work the AI does, the less
                credit you earn.<br>

                For each of the first two units of the course (War and
                Love) you will write a short paper on an issue raised in
                some reading(s) assigned for that unit. By &#8220;short&#8221; I
                mean 1200-1700 words, about 4-5 pages. <br>

                your short papers should be argumentative: you should
                take a side on something smart people might disagree
                about and argue for it. To do this effectively in a
                short space, you will need to limit the scope of your
                essay. For example: <br>
              </font>
              <ul>
                <li><font size="-1">For War, do not try to take on
                    Realism, or Machiavelli. Instead, you might, say,
                    take one of Machiavelli&#8217;s examples and carefully
                    evaluate his use of it, examining how well it
                    supports the conclusion he wants to draw from it.
                    Instead of taking on Walzer, or Orend, for example,
                    you might select one argument that is well
                    articulated in one text and critically appraise it.

                        of a sentence or two explaining how that source
                        is relevant to your topic. Relax: I do not

                      argument for X. Here are some objections to X.
                      Here's why those objections don't defeat the

                      is never justified, and gives appealing reasons
                      for this position. But I'll show that (at least
                      under certain circumstances) it is nevertheless
                      justified.")</span></font></li>
