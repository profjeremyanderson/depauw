                    and rewrite. </span>Do not turn in your first
                  draft, no matter how great a writer you are. Complete
                  the paper and then let it sit for at least a few
                  hours. Then come back and revise the whole thing to
                  make it even clearer and more logical. Then repeat
                  that process. I also recommend you get assistance from

                  is a bad idea to start the paper right before it is

                this topic: to do (1) well, there are two challenges to
                keep in mind. The first is stating the maxim so it&nbsp;
                fits the situation. The second is to remember <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">Kant is not a
                  consequentialist</span>. A maxim doesn't pass the
                4-step test by having good results but by being
                logically possible to universalize (step 3), and
                logically consistent to will (step 4). </font><br>
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li><font size="-1">Kant argues that the that the moral
                  law can only be justified <span style="font-style:
                    italic;">a priori</span> (by pure reason), and not
                  by anything related to human nature or circumstances
                  (Kant 1). Several authors we've read would disagree,
                  including Rachels, Aquinas, Glaucon, Bentham, and
                  Mill. You could present Kant's argument as charitably
                  as possible, present an opposing view from one of the
                  others, and argue for who makes the better case about
                  how morality can be justified.<br>
                  <br>
                </font></li>
              <li><font size="-1">Feldman argues that Kant's Formula of
                  Universal Law is faulty because it (a) permits some
                  actions which really are wrong and (b) forbids some
                  actions which really should be allowed OK (Feldman,
                  226-7). You could present one of those criticisms --
                  (a) or (b) --&nbsp; and then critically evaluate
                  whether Feldman's criticism of Kant is fair. <br>
                  <br>
                  Advice for this one: avoid writing an "Amen!"
                  paper--one where you present Feldman's criticism and
                  basically say, "Yeah, Feldman's right." That is too
                  easy! It's not much more than writing up notes from
                  class. You need to subject Feldman to serious
                  scrutiny. For example, you might grant that Feldman is
                  right that the FUL has problems, but consider whether
                  those problems are any worse than, say, some problem
                  we noted with some consequentialist theory. Or you
                  might argue that Feldman is mistaken--that he has been
                  unfair to Kant in some way. <br>

              Our texts have promoted competing ideas about the basis of
              morality: that there is no basis (Thrasymachus); that
              morality's sole basis is culture (Benedict); and that
              there is some universal, objective basis (Rachels, King,
              and Aquinas). They cannot all be right. <br>
              <br>
              So where do you stand? Well, that's too big a question for
              a short paper. So let's make it more specific: write a
              paper in which you take a stand on one of our readings, or
              (since some of them said a whole lot), some significant
              part of one of our readings. <br>

                  might consider whether some objection(s) from Socrates
                  (Plato, 22-34) raises later in the Plato reading, such
                  as the one about the band of robbers (30-1). What
                  conclusions, if any, can we draw about Thrasymachus'
                  view on the value or nature of justice? <br>

              <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">Benedict
                  argues that society shapes most of its members to fit
                  within its norms (6). She suggests this "moulding" is
                  so profound that when we judge others we can do it
                  only via the norms of our society, which vary so
                  radically it is doubtful we can have any objective
                  basis for morality (5). For a paper on Benedict, you
                  might discuss: To what extent, if any, is she right
                  about this? You might consider Benedict in light of
                  Rachels's argument that there is less moral
                  disagreement than it seems (Rachels, 5-6), or
                  Rachels's argument that all cultures must have some
                  values in common (Rachels, 7), or some other argument
                  for moral objectivism from Rachels, King, or Aquinas.

                  His article is divided into nine sections. You could
                  focus your paper on any one of section 3, 4, 5, 6, or
                  7. For example, Rachels rejects the "Cultural
                  Differences" argument in section 3; your paper could
                  consider whether his rejection applies to Benedict.
                  Rachels points to consequences of taking cultural
                  relativism seriously in section 4; your paper could
                  discuss how big a problem they are (or not). Is he
                  right that there is less disagreement than it seems
                  (section 5)? How plausible is his argument that all
                  cultures have some rules in common (section 6)? In
                  section 7, does Rachels manage to show that there is a
                  culture-neutral standard of right and wrong (section
                  7)? For any of these, you might consider how someone
                  else, like Thrasymachus or Benedict, might differ from
                  Rachels. <br>
