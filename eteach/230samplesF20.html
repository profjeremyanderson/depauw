                        gives an example where following Cephalus'
                        definition of justice would lead us to do
                        something unjust. Suppose someone loaned you
                        weapons while he was sane, but then wants them
                        back when he is insane. To give the weapons back

                        (maybe by telling him truthfully where they are?

                good. It says a lot less than was discussed in class. It
                shows minimal understanding; it's about a "C." <br>

                          different views about the basis of moral
                          rules--that is, about how moral rules get
                          their validity, if any.<br>
                          <br>
                          Moral skepticism admits that there are moral
                          rules, but it says they have no basis, or none
                          we can know for sure. So, skeptics think there
                          are no real moral obligations. Moral
                          skepticism suggests that ethics are a kind of
                          fraud.<br>
                          <br>
                          Unlike moral skepticism, moral subjectivism
                          says that moral rules can be justified, and
                          they are justified by your opinion. In other
                          words, subjectivism holds that an act is right
                          only if you think it is; otherwise it is not.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Cultural relativism also says that moral rules
                          can be justified. Unlike subjectivism,
                          cultural relativism says the basis of moral
                          rules is culture: an act is right only if your
                          culture approves of it; otherwise not. <br>
                          <br>
                          Ethical objectivism says that at least some
                          (but not necessarily all) moral rules have a
                          basis independent of personal opinion or
                          culture, such that they apply to everyone
                          regardless of what their individual judgment
                          or society says.<br>

                Here's an example: imagine a situation where a
                conservative Saudi Muslim, Azim, condemns Beth's
                immodest clothing and Beth--a liberal American
                atheist--condemns Azim's attempt to control her
                behavior. I might ask, <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Explain


















                  how Aquinas might resolve the dispute between Azim and
                  Beth. In other words, given what Aquinas says in the
                  assigned reading, is there any prospect of resolving
                  their dispute? What might it be? What&#8217;s most important
                  here is to say how Aquinas would approach this
                  matter."</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
                <br>
                Here you are asked to take ideas from Aquinas and apply
                them to a possible situation. This is a dispute where
                Azim and Beth dislike each other's behavior and this
                dislike is connected with moral rules of their
                respective cultures.<br>

                          convert to Christianity and obey its rules.

                merely on knowing Aquinas was Christian, without ever
                doing the reading or paying attention in class. So this
                is a bad answer.<br>

                          the reading we have, it&#8217;s hard to tell exactly
                          how Aquinas might resolve Azim &amp; Beth&#8217;s
                          dispute. Aquinas gives us a universal moral
                          standard of natural law that might be used to
                          settle disputes between people from different
                          cultures. But it&#8217;s not clear that this
                          standard (at least what we have of it) tells
                          us what to do to settle this case.<br>
                          <br>
                          On one hand, Aquinas definitely thinks there
                          are some universal moral truths. There are
                          some precepts we can figure out by observing
                          human nature (Aquinas, 4-5), and anyone&#8217;s
                          behavior may be judged by those precepts.
                          Moreover, any particular rule in a given
                          society may be evaluated by reference to those
                          precepts. Because of this, it seems that for
                          Aquinas there may be some way of resolving
                          this dispute--that is, some way we can get
                          beyond the unproductive head-butting of
                          subjectivism (which leaves us with &#8220;he said
                          vs. she said&#8221;) or cultural relativism (which
                          leaves us with &#8220;his culture says vs. her
                          culture says&#8221;).&nbsp; <br>
                          <br>
                          More specifically, Aquinas says that we all
                          seek the good and that we are naturally
                          inclined towards some particular goods,
                          including social living (<span
                            style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>, 5;
                          cf. </font><font size="-1"><span
                            style="font-style: italic;">De Regno</span>,
                          1</font><font size="-1">). He says that
                          "whatever pertains to this inclination belongs
                          to the natural law; for instance...to avoid
                          offending those among whom one has to live" (<span
                            style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>,
                          5). This means that natural law tells us to do
                          what will help us live socially, and that
                          includes avoiding offending people. Also, he
                          emphatically says that law always tells us to
                          seek the common good, not just our own private
                          good, because as members of society we are
                          like parts of a whole (<span
                            style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>,
                          2). Azim and Beth are offending each other, so
                          we could at least conclude that their dispute
                          should not continue, especially if it could
                          lead to any disruption of society. <br>
                          <br>
                          On the other hand, Aquinas allows that a given
                          moral rule--not one of the precepts of the law
                          of nature, but a human-made moral rule derived
                          from the precepts--may not apply in all
                          particular cases. For example, he says it is
                          generally right to give back what you have
                          borrowed, but not if they would be used "to
                          fight against one's country" (<span
                            style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>,
                          5). Aquinas says the precepts--which he
                          sometimes calls "general principles" (<span
                            style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>, 5)
                          apply to everyone. But to apply the precepts
                          we derive "secondary principles" (<span
                            style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>,
                          6)--the particular rules of our society--which
                          might not always apply. He identifies two ways
                          in which a given rule may fail to apply
                          universally. First, it may apply in some
                          societies but not others. A modern example of
                          this is the rule of driving on the right side
                          of the road. Second, like the rule about
                          giving back what is "held in trust<span
                            style="font-style: italic;"></span>" (<span
                            style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>,
                          5), there may be circumstances where justice
                          requires an exception to a rule that is
                          generally legitimate. <br>
                          <br>
                          So Aquinas gives us a general approach to
                          discovering the universal moral law:
                          identifying first principles, then deriving
                          secondary principles from them which we can
                          then apply to particular situations. <br>
                          <br>
                          But given what is said in the readings and the
                          prompt, it is not clear how this might resolve
                          Azim and Beth's disagreement. Is Azim's rule
                          about women's public attire more clearly
                          justified by the precepts than Beth's, or vice
                          versa? Can we deduce from the precepts some
                          rule about how to adjudicate their dispute?
                          The answers to these questions are not
                          obvious. Perhaps it would be helpful if we
                          knew more. For example, if the dispute were
                          taking place in Saudi Arabia--which takes
                          rules about women's attire much more seriously
                          than the United States--Aquinas might say that
                          the potential for social disruption and giving
                          offense to others is lower if Beth wears a
                          veil, and that therefore she ought to do so. </font>

              <font size="-1">Wow, right? That's impressive. This would
                get an 'A.'<br>
                <br>
                This answer does not say "Aquinas would say that Azim
                and/or Beth should do X." But that's fine, because the
                answer gives reasons, grounded in the Aquinas reading,
                for why it's hard to come to such a neat conclusion.
                That's what to do here: show how Aquinas thinks about a
                situation. <br>
                <br>
                However, if your answer shows a way that Aquinas could
                resolve their dispute which is consistent with his
                general principles, that'd be great, too. <br>
