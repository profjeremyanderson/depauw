                  <font size="-1">[1] The stone is given its existence;
                    it need not fight for being what it is--a stone in
                    the field. Man has to be himself in spite of
                    unfavorable circumstances; that means he has to make
                    his own existence at every single moment. He is
                    given the abstract possibility of existing, but not
                    the reality. This he has to conquer hour after hour.
                    Man must earn his life, not only economically but
                    metaphysically. </font></span><font size="-1"><br

                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[2] And all this
                    for what reason? Obviously--but this is repeating
                    the same thing in other words--because man's being
                    and nature's being do not fully coincide. Because
                    man's being is made of such strange stuff as to be
                    partly akin to nature and partly not, at once
                    natural and extranatural, a kind of ontological
                    centaur, half immersed in nature, half transcending
                    it. Dante would have likened him to a boat drawn up
                    on the beach with one end of its keel in the water
                    and the other in the sand. What is natural in him is
                    realized by itself; it presents no problem. That is
                    precisely why man does not consider it his true
                    being. His extranatural part, on the other hand, is
                    not there from the outset and of itself; it is but
                    an aspiration, a project of life. And this we feel
                    to be our true being; we call it our personality,
                    our self. Our extra- and antinatural portion,
                    however, must not be interpreted in terms of any of
                    the older spiritual philosophies. I am not
                    interested now in the so-called spirit (Geist), a
                    pretty confused idea laden with speculative
                    wizardry. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[3] If the reader
                    reflects a little upon the meaning of the entity he
                    calls his life, he will find that it is the attempt
                    to carry out a definite program or project of
                    existence. And his self--each man's self--is nothing
                    but this devised program. All we do we do in the
                    service of this program. Thus man begins by being
                    something that has no reality, neither corporeal nor
                    spiritual; he is a project as such, something which
                    is not yet but aspires to be. One may object that
                    there can be no program without somebody having it,
                    without an idea, a mind, a soul, or whatever it is
                    called. I cannot discuss this thoroughly because it
                    would mean embarking on a course of philosophy. But
                    I will say this: although the project of being a
                    great financier has to be conceived of in an idea,
                    "being" the project is different from holding the
                    idea. In fact, I find no difficulty in thinking this
                    idea but I am very far from being this project. </span><br

                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[4] Here we come
                    upon the formidable and unparalleled character which
                    makes man unique in the universe. We are
                    dealing--and let the disquieting strangeness of the
                    case be well noted--with an entity whose being
                    consists not in what it is already, but in what it
                    is not yet, a being that consists in not-yet-being.
                    Everything else in the world is what it is. An
                    entity whose mode of being consists in what it is
                    already, whose potentiality coincides at once with
                    his reality, we call a "thing." Things are given
                    their being ready-made. </span><br

                    moment of my life there open before me diverse
                    possibilities: I can do this or that. If I do this,
                    I shall be A the moment after; if I do that, I shall
                    be B. At the present moment the reader may stop
                    reading me or may go on. And, however slight the
                    importance of this article, according as he does the
                    one or the other the reader will be A or will be B,
                    will have made of himself an A or a B. Man is the
                    entity that makes itself, an entity which
                    traditional ontology has only stumbled upon
                    precisely as its course was drawing to a close, and
                    which it in consequence gave up the attempt to
                    understand: the causa sui [self-caused thing]. With
                    this difference, that the causa sui had only to
                    "exert itself" in being the cause of itself and not
                    in determining what self it was going to cause. It
                    had, to begin with, a self previously determined and
                    invariable, consistent, for example, to infinity. </span><br

                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[6] But man must
                    not only make himself: the weightiest thing he has
                    to do is to determine what he is going to be. He is
                    causa sui to the second power. By a coincidence that
                    is not casual, the doctrine of the living being,
                    when it seeks in tradition for concepts that are
                    still more or less valid, finds only those which the
                    doctrine of the divine being tried to formulate. If
                    the reader has resolved now to go on reading into
                    the next moment, it will be, in the last instance,
                    because doing this is what is most in accordance
                    with the general program he has mapped out for his
                    life, and hence with the man of determination he has
                    resolved to be. This vital program is the ego of
                    each individual, his choice out of diverse
                    possibilities of being which at every instant open
                    before him. </span><br style="font-family:

                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[7] Concerning
                    these possibilities of being the following remarks
                    fall to be made: </span><br style="font-family:
                    Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[8]&nbsp; 1. That
                    they likewise are not presented to me. I must find
                    them for myself, either on my own or through the
                    medium of those of my fellows with whom my life
                    brings me in contact. I invent projects of being and
                    of doing in the light of circumstance. This alone I
                    come upon, this alone is given me: circumstance. It
                    is too often forgotten that man is impossible
                    without imagination, without the capacity to invent
                    for himself a conception of life, to "ideate" the
                    character he is going to be. Whether he be original
                    or a plagiarist, man is the novelist of himself. </span><br
                    style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[9]&nbsp; 2. That
                    among these possibilities I must choose. Hence, I am
                    free. But be it well understood, I am free by
                    compulsion, whether I wish to be or not. Freedom is
                    not an activity pursued by an entity that, apart
                    from and previous to such pursuit, is already
                    possessed of a fixed being. To be free means to be
                    lacking in constitutive identity, not to have
                    subscribed to a determined being, to be able to be
                    other than what one was, to be unable to install
                    oneself once and for all in any given being. The
                    only attribute of the fixed stable being in the free
                    being is this constitutive instability. </span><br

                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[10] In order to
                    speak, then, of man's being we must first elaborate
                    a non-Eleatic concept of being, as others have
                    elaborated a non-Euclidean geometry. The time has
                    come for the seed sown by Heraclitus to bring forth
                    its mighty harvest. . . . [Note: The Eleatics were
                    ancient Greek followers of Parmenides, who argued
                    that there is no motion, time, or change, and hence
                    that everything is fixed and unchanging. Heraclitus,
                    on the other hand, was another ancient Greek who
                    argued that everything is constantly changing.
                    Ortega favors Heraclitus's view over Parmenides'.

                  <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[11] Man invents
                    for himself a program of life, a static form of
                    being, that gives a satisfactory answer to the
                    difficulties posed for him by circumstance. He
                    essays this form of life, attempts to realize this
                    imaginary character he has resolved to be. He
                    embarks on the essay full of illusions and
                    prosecutes the experiment with thoroughness. This
                    means that he comes to believe deeply that his
                    character is his real being. But meanwhile the
                    experience has made apparent the shortcomings and
                    limitations of the said program of life. It does not
                    solve all the difficulties, and it creates new ones
                    of its own. When first seen it was full face, with
                    the light shining upon it: hence the illusions, the
                    enthusiasm, the delights believed in store. With the
                    back view its inadequacy is straightway revealed.
                    Man thinks out another program of life. But this
                    second program is drawn up in the light, not only of
                    circumstance, but also of the first. One aims at
                    avoiding in the new project the drawbacks of the
                    old. In the second, therefore, the first is still
                    active; it is preserved in order to be avoided.
                    Inexorably man shrinks from being what he was. On
                    the second project of being, the second thorough
                    experiment, there follows a third, forged in the
                    light of the second and the first, and so on. Man
                    "goes on being" and "unbeing"--living. He goes on
                    accumulating being--the past; he goes on making for
                    himself a being through his dialectical series of
                    experiments. This is a dialectic not of logical but
                    precisely of historical reason--the

                    of somewhere in his papers by Dilthey, the writer to
                    whom we owe more than to anyone else concerning the
                    idea of life, and who is, to my mind, the most
                    important thinker of the second half of the
                    nineteenth century. </span><br style="font-family:

                    this dialectic that will not tolerate the facile
                    anticipations of logical dialectic consist? This is
                    what we have to find out on the basis of facts. We
                    must know what is this series, what are its stages,
                    and of what nature is the link between one and the
                    next. Such a discovery is what would be called
                    history were history to make this its objective,
                    were it, that is to say, to convert itself into
                    historical reason. </span><br style="font-family:

                    awaiting our study, lies man's authentic
                    "being"--stretching the whole length of his past.
                    Man is what has happened to him, what he has done.
                    Other things might have happened to him or have been
                    done by him, but what did in fact happen to him and
                    was done by him, this constitutes a relentless
                    trajectory of experiences that he carries on his
                    back as the vagabond his bundle of all he possesses.
                    Man is a substantial emigrant on a pilgrimage of
                    being, and it is accordingly meaningless to set
                    limits to what he is capable of being. In this
                    initial illimitableness of possibilities that
                    characterizes one who has no nature there stands out
                    only one fixed, pre-established and given line by
                    which he may chart his course, only one limit: the
                    past. The experiments already made with life narrow
                    man's future. If we do not know what he is going to
                    be, we know what he is not going to be. Man lives in
                    view of the past. </span><br style="font-family:
