                          tightly-argued kernel to his political theory.
                          Necessarily, much that is interesting in Locke

                          Kavka-esque, since it's informed by the
                          conceptual framework the late Prof. Greg Kavka
                          gave me for understanding social contract
                          theories. They generally have three parts: (1)
                          they start with a "decision situation" or
                          state of nature, (2) they end up with some
                          form of government that is claimed to be
                          legitimate (a set of "output principles"), and
                          (3) they provide an argument to get you from
                          the former to the latter. </font><br>

                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">When we're all out
                  on our own, we have some nice rights God gave us, and
                  we are all free. Since God gave us those rights,
                  they're ours to keep. No one can take them from us,
                  but we can give them up if we want to. Or we can lose
                  them if we do bad things. </span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br>
                  We can't just do as we please, though. We have a law
                  we should all stick to, and we all can tell what it
                  is. But the thing is, when we're all out on our own we
                  don't all stick to it. Or we don't all see eye to eye
                  on how to stick to it. So we don't have much fun when
                  we keep all those rights. We fight, and life sucks. </span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br>
                  Locke says that if we just get three things, life will
                  cease to suck--well, at least it will cease to suck in
                  some big ways. What we need is one clear set of laws
                  we all stick to, a fair judge to tell us how to stick
                  to those laws, and cops to make us stick to them when
                  we don't feel like it. To get these things, each of us
                  has to say, in a way, "I give up my right to do as I
                  please. From now on, I'll stick to this law and do
                  what the judge says. And if some guys don't stick to
                  the law, I'll help make them." Then we are one, and we
                  can all be free and have fun. </span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br>
                  We can set up a queen or king, or else a group to rule
                  us. But we all have to keep in mind that the law and
                  the judge and the cops can go just so far. The whole
                  point was to have them keep us safe and work for our
                  good. They have to look out for all of us. If they
                  don't, we have to think, "Why did we give up the
                  rights God gave us?" </span><br style="font-family:
                  Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br>
                  But once in a while the law, the judge, or the cops
                  screw up. They may work for their own good and not for
                  ours. Or they may think they don't have to do what the
                  law says. Or some judge or cop may think he gets to be
                  in charge of his own case. If they do that, we don't
                  have to take it. We gave them their jobs, so we can
                  fire them. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br>
                  But that's such a big deal that we don't do it on a
                  whim, or for each time a judge, cop, or law errs. We
                  save it for the big stuff, what Locke calls "a long
                  train" of bad things that make it clear to us that the
                  folks who rule us are not on our side. </span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br>
                  Some might think that what Locke says will make us
                  want to fire the folks in charge all the time, which
                  would be a bad thing to do, a big waste and a big risk
                  to our lives. But Locke says no. He thinks that if all
                  of us (and that means the judge and the cop and those
                  who pass the laws, too) know that we can fire the ones
                  in charge if they screw up too much, they won't screw
                  up so much. And that would be good. It would mean that
                  they work to keep us safe and sound. </span><br>

                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">1. In the State of
                  Nature (SN), we naturally have the liberty to be
                  judges and executors of the Law of Nature in our own
                  cases (4, 6-8), and sometimes in others' too. This
                  liberty is a natural right, given to us by God--so it
                  can't be taken away unless we consent to give it up or
                  forfeit it through misbehavior. </span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;"></span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">2. There are certain
                  "inconveniences" present in the SN, namely various
                  invasions by other people which prevent us from
                  enjoying our liberty (123). </span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;"></span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">3. These
                  inconveniences exist because the SN lacks certain
                  things: </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  (a) a law or "legislative" we all submit to (124) </span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  (b) an impartial judge who decides disputes under that
                  law (a judiciary, 125), and </span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  (c) the power to enforce the judge's decisions (an
                  executive, 126). </span><br style="font-family:

                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">4. These
                  deficiencies arise out of the exercise of our natural
                  liberties. Thus, if we want to escape them, we must
                  give up our natural liberty and unite into a "civil
                  society" (87) and accept the rule of law (129-31).
                  Consenting to legitimate legal restraints--somewhat
                  paradoxically--assures our freedom (57). </span><br

                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">5. The goal for
                  which we left the SN establishes an important limit on
                  government: since we only gave up our natural liberty
                  in order to escape the SN's deficiencies, the sole
                  purpose of government is to remedy those deficiencies
                  by working for the "Peace, Safety, and publick good of
                  the People" (131; cf. Chapter XI). </span><br

                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">6. Thus, while
                  government may take various forms (132), it must
                  always conform to certain fundamental laws: the
                  positive law of establishing the legislative power
                  (without which none of the SN's inconveniences can be
                  remedied (note that premise 3(a) above is a necessary
                  precondition of 3(b) and 3(c)), and the natural law of
                  preserving society--which is the protector of each of
                  us (134). </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;"></span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">7. If government
                  fails to conform to these limits and laws, it fails to
                  do what we created it to do: protect us from those
                  inconveniences mentioned above, no more no less. </span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;"></span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">8. Such failures may
                  take different forms. Among these are tyranny, in
                  which rule is exercised only for the rulers' good
                  (199). This violates the limit established in premise
                  5 above, as well as (arguably) the fundamental natural
                  law in premise 6. Another form of failure is absolute
                  government, in which rulers are not accountable to
                  anyone and are allowed to judge their own cases.
                  Absolute government is really no government at all
                  (90-1). That's because it is an instance of two of the
                  inconveniences of the SN: it is an instance of 3(a)
                  because the ruler is above the law, and it is an
                  instance of 3(b) because absolute rulers are not
                  impartial, at least not when judging their own cases.

                <span style="font-family: Georgia;"></span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">9. If government
                  fails to do what we created it to do, the people
                  (i.e., we who gave up our natural liberty in order to
                  be safe) have the right to alter or abolish it (149).
                </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;"></span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">10. And since the
                  government is appointed by the people--it is their
                  "deputy" (240)--the people are to judge when this is
                  appropriate (240-2). </span><br style="font-family:
                  Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;"></span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">11. Such action is
                  not appropriate for every mismanagement, since
                  revolution is dangerous after all. But it is to be
                  expected after a "long train of abuses" (225). </span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;"></span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">12. Rather than
                  encouraging rebellion, Locke thinks his doctrine is
                  the best defense against it (226). This is because it
                  puts those who are most likely to subvert the
                  law--namely, those in power--on notice that they may
                  justly face violent opposition if they do so. </span><br
