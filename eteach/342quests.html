                for the Early Exam</span></font><br>
            <br>
            The first exam will consist of three of the four questions I
            posted below. Of those three, you will choose two and answer
            them as best you can in class without texts, notes, or other
            aids.<br>
            <br>
            Treat your answers as a chance to show off what you've
            learned in this course and how sensitive you are to the
            issues. Each question gives you the opportunity to
            demonstrate a lot of learning if you connect it to course
            materials as much as you can.<br>
            <br>
            Once the questions are posted, I recommend the following to
            prepare. Review the readings and your notes from class. As
            you consider each question, try to identify everything
            (cases, legal doctrines, moral theories, articles,
            arguments, etc.) that might possibly be relevant to
            answering the question. Then, decide which of those
            considerations are most relevant to the question, and
            helpful for making a decision. Of these, which (if any) are
            decisive, and why? Which considerations might seem decisive
            but turn out to be mistaken? (It would be good to rebut
            these in your answers.)<br>
            <br>
            Questions will ask you to draw some conclusion and justify
            it. In philosophy it is never good merely to state why you
            happen to think something is so. Nor is it good to present
            tricky arguments, attempting to persuade your reader in the
            sort of way, for example, that politicians often try to
            persuade voters. You must always strive to give reasons that
            should persuade any rational reader, without being tricky.
            Your job is to demonstrate as best you honestly can what the
            truth of the matter is. To do this well, keep in mind that
            some smart people will disagree with you, and you must
            strive to persuade them. Thinking well about the questions
            may require you to change your conclusions, and change your
            mind. That is an important kind of growth, and I intend for
            it to happen as part of the process of preparing for the
            exam.<br>

              1. Attempts. </span>Victor is unhappily married to
            Esmeralda. In fact, Victor so despises his wife that he has
            on more than one occasion seriously thought of killing her.
            Victor was raised on a small island in the Caribbean and, as
            a young boy, was initiated into the black-magic cults of the
            native peoples. Victor still retains deep beliefs in the
            power of voodoo magic. One day, when he feels he can stand
            his wife no longer, Victor retires to his secret workshop,
            where he has over the years meticulously collected the
            accoutrements of the black arts. Carefully he prepares a
            tiny, doll-like replica of the despised Esmeralda. When at
            last the doll is finished, Victor takes a deep breath and,
            with nervous fingers and a look of hatred, viciously and
            repeatedly stabs the doll with &#8220;sacred&#8221; needles. Exhausted
            by his deed, Victor collapses. When he awakens, he is
            overcome with remorse and disgust at what he has done. He
            promptly leaves his workshop, marches to the local police
            station, and turns himself in, believing with all sincerity
            that he has murdered his wife.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using relevant concepts and
            readings from this course, explain why Victor might be
            guilty of attempted murder, <span style="font-style:
              italic;">and </span>why he might not. Then explain which
            view (that he is, or is not guilty) should be preferred,
            giving the strongest reasons for why others should agree
            with you. (It will be helpful to review the excerpt from the
            Model Penal Code on p. 490 [4th edition: 405], but in your
            answer you should not merely try to apply the letter of the
            law.)&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. </span><span
              style="font-weight: bold;">Excuses. </span>Consider the
            following excerpt from an 1897 criminal case in Canada:<br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
              appeared from the evidence that the prisoner was a member
              of a tribe of pagan Indians who believed in the existence
              of an evil spirit clothed in human flesh, or in human form
              called a Wendigo which would eat a human being.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That it was reported that a
              Wendigo had been seen and it was supposed was in the
              neighbourhood of their camp desiring to do them harm. That
              among other precautions to protect themselves, guards and
              sentries, the prisoner being one, were placed out in pairs
              armed with firearms (the prisoner having a rifle); that
              the prisoner saw what appeared to be a tall human being
              running in the distance, which he supposed was the
              Wendigo; that he and another Indian gave chase, and after
              challenging three times and receiving no answer fired and
              shot the object, when it was discovered to be his own
              foster father, who died soon afterward.<br>
            </div>
            <br>
            The defense argued that the defendant lacked the &#8220;intention
            even to harm a human being, much less to kill.&#8221; The court
            rejected the defendant&#8217;s argument. Was the court correct?
            Using relevant concepts and readings from this course,
            explain why it may have been, <span style="font-style:
              italic;">and </span>why it might not have been. Then,
            argue for which view is the right one, giving the strongest
            reasons for why others should agree with you.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Justification, excuse,
              or neither? </span>Defendant Haynes, an inmate in a
            federal prison, suddenly attacked another prisoner by
            pouring scalding oil on the other inmate&#8217;s head as he played
            dominoes. In defense, Haynes claims that the victim had
            threatened more than once to sexually assault Haynes. The
            day before the attack, the victim had thrown Haynes to the
            ground within sight of a guard, who did nothing. On the day
            of the attack, the victim had threatened to &#8220;finish what he
            started.&#8221; The court held that Haynes could not argue
            self-defense in the form of a pre-emptive strike: &#8220;Under the
            law of the jungle, a good offense may be the best defense,&#8221;
            the court wrote, &#8220;but although prisons are nasty places,
            they are not jungles.&#8221; Because Haynes &#8220;was not faced with an
            imminent use of force&#8221; by the victim, he should have used
            other, lawful alternatives.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the court correct to rule
            Haynes could not claim it was self-defense? Using relevant
            concepts and readings from this course, explain why it may
            have been, <span style="font-style: italic;">and </span>why







            it might not have been. Then, argue for which view is the
            right one, giving the strongest reasons for why others
            should agree with you. Should Haynes&#8217; act be considered
            justified? Excused? Neither? How come?<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Culpability. </span>Scott




            Falater, a former head of a church in Arizona, was charged
            with murder in the death of his wife. The victim had been
            stabbed multiple times and dragged into the family swimming
            pool. Falater defended himself with the aid of a witness who
            claimed that Falater was a sleepwalker. Sleep-disorder
            specialists also testified that Falater met the profile of a
            sleepwalker, capable of unconscious behavior. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you were the judge hearing this
            case, would you rule that Falater did not commit an &#8220;act&#8221;
            for which he could be held accountable because of his
            sleepwalking? Using relevant concepts and cases from the
            course, explain why you should, and why you should not. Then
            explain which is the correct ruling, giving the strongest
            reasons for why others should agree with you. Consider the
            language of Model Penal Code 2.01: &#8220;the following are not
            voluntary acts...(1) a reflex or convulsion; (b) a bodily
            movement during unconsciousness or sleep....&#8221; Finally, what
            does this case, and your evaluation of it, tell us about
            responsibility for what one does?<br>
