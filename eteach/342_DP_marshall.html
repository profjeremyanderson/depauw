</center>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">In order to assess
whether or not death is an
excessive or
unnecessary
penalty, it is necessary to consider the reasons why a legislature
might select it as punishment for one or more offenses, and examine
whether less severe penalties would satisfy the legitimate legislative
wants as well as capital punishment. If they would, then the death
penalty is unnecessary cruelty, and, therefore, unconstitutional.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">There are six
purposes conceivably served by capital
punishment: retribution, deterrence, prevention of repetitive criminal
acts, encouragement of guilty pleas and confessions, eugenics, and
economy. These are considered seriatim below.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">A. [...] The fact
that the State may seek
retribution against those
who have
broken its laws does not mean that retribution may then become the
State's sole end in punishing. Our jurisprudence has always accepted
deterrence in general, deterrence of individual recidivism, isolation
of dangerous persons, and rehabilitation as proper goals of punishment.
See Trop v. Dulles, <a
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?navby=volpage&amp;court=us&amp;vol=356&amp;page=111#111">356
U.S., at 111
</a> (BRENNAN, J., concurring). Retaliation, vengeance, and retribution
have been roundly condemned as intolerable aspirations for a government
in a free society.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Punishment as
retribution has been condemned by
scholars for
centuries,
<a name="t85"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f85">85
</a> and the Eighth Amendment itself was adopted to prevent punishment
from becoming synonymous with vengeance. [...]<br>
</p>
<font style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">B. The most
hotly contested issue regarding capital
punishment
is whether it is better than life imprisonment as a deterrent to crime.
<a name="t89"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f89">89
</a>&nbsp;
</font>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">While the contrary
position has been argued,
<a name="t90"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f90">90
</a> it is my firm opinion that the death penalty is a more severe
sanction than life imprisonment. Admittedly, there are <font
 color="#005500">
<a name="346">[408 U.S. 238, 346]
</a>&nbsp;
</font> some persons who would rather die than languish
in prison for a
lifetime. But, whether or not they should be able to choose death as an
alternative is a far different question from that presented here - i.
e., whether the State can impose death as a punishment. Death is
irrevocable; life imprisonment is not. Death, of course, makes
rehabilitation impossible; life imprisonment does not. In short, death
has always been viewed as the ultimate sanction, and it seems perfectly
reasonable to continue to view it as such.

</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">It must be kept in
mind, then, that the question to
be considered is
not simply whether capital punishment is <font color="#005500">
<a name="347">[408 U.S. 238, 347]
</a>&nbsp;
</font> a deterrent, but whether it is a better
deterrent than life
imprisonment.

</a>[...]
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Thorsten Sellin,
one of the leading authorities on
capital
punishment, has urged that if the death penalty <font color="#005500">
<a name="349">[408 U.S. 238, 349]
</a>&nbsp;
</font> deters prospective murderers, the following
hypotheses should
be true:
</p>
<ul style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
"(a) Murders should be less frequent in states that
have the
death penalty than in those that have abolished it, other factors being
equal. Comparisons of this nature must be made among states that are as
alike as possible in all other respects - character of population,
social and economic condition, etc. - in order not to introduce factors
known to influence murder rates in a serious manner but present in only
one of these states.
</ul>
<ul style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
"(b) Murders should increase when the death penalty
is abolished and
should decline when it is restored.
</ul>
<ul style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
"(c) The deterrent effect should be greatest and
should therefore
affect murder rates most powerfully in those communities where the
crime occurred and its consequences are most strongly brought home to
the population.
</ul>
<ul style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
"(d) Law enforcement officers would be safer from
murderous
attacks in states that have the death penalty than in those without
it." <a name="t99"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f99">99
  </a> (Footnote omitted.)
</ul>
<font style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Sellin's
evidence indicates that not one of these
propositions is true. [...]&nbsp;
</font>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Sellin's
statistics demonstrate that there is no
correlation between
the murder rate and the presence or absence of the capital sanction. He
compares States that have similar characteristics and finds that
irrespective of their position on capital punishment, they have similar
murder rates. In the New England States, for example, there is no
correlation between executions
<a name="t102"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f102">102
</a> and homicide rates.
<a name="t103"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f103">103
</a> The same is true for Midwestern States,
<a name="t104"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f104">104
</a> and for all others studied. Both the United Nations
<a name="t105"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f105">105

<a name="t106"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f106">106
</a> have acknowledged the validity of Sellin's statistics.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Sellin also
concludes that abolition and/or
reintroduction of
the death penalty had no effect on the homicide rates of the various
States involved.
<a name="t107"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f107">107
</a> This conclusion is borne out by others who have made similar <font

</a>&nbsp;
</font> inquiries

<a name="t109"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f109">109
</a> Despite problems with the statistics,
<a name="t110"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f110">110
</a> Sellin's evidence has been relied upon in international studies of
capital punishment.

</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Statistics also
show that the deterrent effect of
capital
punishment is no greater in those communities where executions take
place than in other communities.
<a name="t112"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f112">112
</a> In fact, there is some evidence that imposition of capital
punishment may actually encourage crime, rather than deter it.
<a name="t113"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f113">113
</a> And, while police and law enforcement officers <font
 color="#005500">
<a name="352">[408 U.S. 238, 352]
</a>&nbsp;
</font> are the strongest advocates of capital
punishment,
<a name="t114"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f114">114
</a> the evidence is overwhelming that police are no safer in
communities that retain the sanction than in those that have abolished
it.
<a name="t115"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f115">115
</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">There is also a
substantial body of data showing
that the
existence of the death penalty has virtually no effect on the homicide
rate in prisons.
<a name="t116"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f116">116
</a> Most of the persons sentenced to death are murderers, and
murderers tend to be model prisoners.
<a name="t117"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f117">117

353]
</a>&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">In sum, the only
support for the theory that capital
punishment
is an effective deterrent is found in the hypotheses with which we
began and the occasional stories about a specific individual being
deterred from doing a contemplated criminal act.
<a name="t118"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f118">118
</a> These claims of specific deterrence are often spurious,
<a name="t119"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f119">119
</a> however, and may be more than counterbalanced by the tendency of
capital punishment to incite certain crimes.
<a name="t120"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f120">120&nbsp;
</a>[...]</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Despite the fact
that abolitionists have not proved
non-deterrence beyond a reasonable doubt, they have succeeded in
showing by clear and convincing evidence that capital punishment is not
necessary as a deterrent to crime in our society. This is all that they
must do. We would shirk our judicial responsibilities if we failed to
accept the presently existing statistics and demanded more proof. It
may be that we now possess all the proof that anyone could ever hope to
assemble on the subject. But, even if further proof were to be
forthcoming, I believe there is more than enough evidence presently
available for a decision in this case.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">In 1793 William
Bradford studied the utility of the
death
penalty in Pennsylvania and found that it probably had no deterrent
effect but that more evidence <font color="#005500">
<a name="354">[408 U.S. 238, 354]
</a>&nbsp;
</font> was needed.
<a name="t122"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f122">122
</a> Edward Livingston reached a similar conclusion with respect to
deterrence in 1833 upon completion of his study for Louisiana.
<a name="t123"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f123">123
</a> Virtually every study that has since been undertaken has reached
the same result.
<a name="t124"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f124">124
</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">In light of the
massive amount of evidence before
us, I see no
alternative but to conclude that capital punishment cannot be justified
on the basis of its deterrent effect.
<a name="t125"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f125">125
</a>&nbsp;
<font color="#005500"><a name="355">[408 U.S. 238,
355]
</a>&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">C. Much of what
must be said about the death penalty
as a device
to prevent recidivism is obvious - if a murderer is executed, he cannot
possibly commit another offense. The fact is, however, that murderers
are extremely unlikely to commit other crimes either in prison or upon
their release.
<a name="t126"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f126">126
</a> For the most part, they are first offenders, and when released
from prison they are known to become model citizens.
<a name="t127"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f127">127
</a> Furthermore, most persons who commit capital crimes are not
executed. With respect to those who are sentenced to die, it is
critical to note that the jury is never asked to determine whether they
are likely to be recidivists. In light of these facts, if capital
punishment were justified purely on the basis of preventing recidivism,
it would have to be considered to be excessive; no general need to
obliterate all capital offenders could have been demonstrated, nor any
specific need in individual cases.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">D. The three final
purposes which may underlie
utilization of a
capital sanction - encouraging guilty pleas and confessions, eugenics,
and reducing state expenditures - may be dealt with quickly. If the
death penalty is used to encourage guilty pleas and thus to deter
suspects from exercising their rights under the Sixth Amendment to jury
trials, it is unconstitutional. United States <font color="#005500">
<a name="356">[408 U.S. 238, 356]
</a>&nbsp;
</font> v. Jackson, <a
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=390&amp;invol=570">390
U.S. 570
</a> (1968).
<a name="t128"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f128">128
</a> Its elimination would do little to impair the State's bargaining
position in criminal cases, since life imprisonment remains a severe
sanction which can be used as leverage for bargaining for pleas or
confessions in exchange either for charges of lesser offenses or
recommendations of leniency.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Moreover, to the
extent that capital punishment is
used to
encourage confessions and guilty pleas, it is not being used for
punishment purposes. A State that justifies capital punishment on its
utility as part of the conviction process could not profess to rely on
capital punishment as a deterrent. Such a State's system would be
structured with twin goals only: obtaining guilty pleas and confessions
and imposing imprisonment as the maximum sanction. Since life
imprisonment is sufficient for bargaining purposes, the death penalty
is excessive if used for the same purposes.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">In light of the
previous discussion on deterrence,
any
suggestions concerning the eugenic benefits of capital punishment are
obviously meritless.
<a name="t129"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f129">129
</a> As I pointed out above, there is not even any attempt made to
discover which capital offenders are likely to be recidivists, let
alone which are positively incurable. No test or procedure presently
exists by which incurables can be screened from those who would benefit
from treatment. On the one hand, due process would seem to require that
we have some procedure to demonstrate incurability before execution;
and, on the other hand, equal protection would then seemingly require
that all incurables be executed, cf. Skinner v. Oklahoma, <a
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=316&amp;invol=535">316
U.S. 535
</a> (1942). In addition, the "cruel and unusual" language <font
 color="#005500">
<a name="357">[408 U.S. 238, 357]
</a>&nbsp;
</font> would require that life imprisonment,
treatment, and
sterilization be inadequate for eugenic purposes. More importantly,
this Nation has never formally professed eugenic goals, and the history
of the world does not look kindly on them. If eugenics is one of our
purposes, then the legislatures should say so forthrightly and design
procedures to serve this goal. Until such time, I can only conclude, as
has virtually everyone else who has looked at the problem,
<a name="t130"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f130">130
</a> that capital punishment cannot be defended on the basis of any
eugenic purposes.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">As for the
argument that it is cheaper to execute a
capital
offender than to imprison him for life, even assuming that such an
argument, if true, would support a capital sanction, it is simply
incorrect. A disproportionate amount of money spent on prisons is
attributable to death row.

although they could be,

<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">At trial, the
selection of jurors is likely to
become a costly,
time-consuming problem in a capital case,
<a name="t135"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f135">135
</a> and defense counsel will reasonably exhaust every possible means
to save his client from execution, no matter how long the trial takes.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">During the period
between conviction and execution,
there are
an inordinate number of collateral attacks on the conviction and
attempts to obtain executive clemency, all of which exhaust the time,
money, and effort of the State. There are also continual assertions
that the condemned prisoner has gone insane.
<a name="t136"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f136">136
</a> Because there is a formally established policy of not executing
insane persons,
<a name="t137"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f137">137
</a> great sums of money may be spent on detecting and curing mental
illness in order to perform the execution.

 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f138">138
</a> Since no one wants the responsibility for the execution, the
condemned man is likely to be passed back and forth from doctors to
custodial officials to courts like a ping-pong ball.
<a name="t139"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f139">139
</a> The entire process is very costly.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">When all is said
and done, there can be no doubt
that it costs more
to execute a man than to keep him in prison for life.

</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">E. There is but
one conclusion that can be drawn
from all of
this - i. e., the death penalty is an excessive and unnecessary
punishment that violates the Eighth <font color="#005500">
<a name="359">[408 U.S. 238, 359]
</a>&nbsp;
</font> Amendment. The statistical evidence is not
convincing beyond
all doubt, but it is persuasive. It is not improper at this point to
take judicial notice of the fact that for more than 200 years men have
labored to demonstrate that capital punishment serves no purpose that
life imprisonment could not serve equally well. And they have done so
with great success. Little, if any, evidence has been adduced to prove
the contrary. The point has now been reached at which deference to the
legislatures is tantamount to abdication of our judicial roles as
factfinders, judges, and ultimate arbiters of the Constitution. We know
that at some point the presumption of constitutionality accorded
legislative acts gives way to a realistic assessment of those acts.
This point comes when there is sufficient evidence available so that
judges can determine, not whether the legislature acted wisely, but
whether it had any rational basis whatsoever for acting. We have this
evidence before us now. There is no rational basis for concluding that
capital punishment is not excessive. It therefore violates the Eighth
Amendment.

<h3>VI
</h3>
</center>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">In addition, even
if capital punishment is not
excessive, it
nonetheless violates the Eighth Amendment because it is morally
unacceptable to the people of the United States at this time in their
history.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">In judging whether
or not a given penalty is morally
acceptable, most courts have said that the punishment is valid unless
"it shocks the conscience and sense of justice of the people."

</a>&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Judge Frank once
noted the problems inherent in the
use of such a
measuring stick:
</p>
<ul style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
"[The court,] before it reduces a sentence as `cruel
and
unusual,' must have reasonably good assurances that the sentence
offends the `common conscience.' And, in any context, such a standard -
the community's attitude - is usually an unknowable. It resembles a
slithery shadow, since one can seldom learn, at all accurately, what
the community, or a majority, actually feels. Even a carefully-taken
`public opinion poll' would be inconclusive in a case like this." <a
 name="t143"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f143">143
  </a>&nbsp;
</ul>
<font style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">While a public
opinion poll obviously is of some
assistance in
indicating public acceptance or rejection of a specific penalty,
<a name="t144"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f144">144
</a> its utility cannot be very great. This is because whether or not a
punishment is cruel and unusual depends, not on whether its mere
mention "shocks the conscience and sense of justice of the people," but
on whether people who were fully informed as to the purposes of the
penalty and its liabilities would find the penalty shocking, unjust,
and unacceptable.
<a name="t145"

</a>&nbsp;
</font>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">In other words,
the question with which we must deal
is not whether
a substantial proportion of American citizens would today, if polled,
opine that capital punishment is barbarously cruel, but whether they
would find it to be so in the light of all information presently
available.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">This is not to
suggest that with respect to this
test of
unconstitutionality people are required to act rationally; they are
not. With respect to this judgment, a violation of the Eighth Amendment
is totally dependent on the predictable subjective, emotional reactions
of informed citizens.
<a name="t146"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f146">146
</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">It has often been
noted that American citizens know
almost nothing
about capital punishment.
<a name="t147"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f147">147
</a> Some of the conclusions arrived at in the preceding section and
the supporting evidence would be critical to an informed judgment on
the morality of the death penalty: e. g., that the death penalty is no
more effective a deterrent than life imprisonment, that convicted
murderers are <font color="#005500">
<a name="363">[408 U.S. 238, 363]
</a>&nbsp;
</font> rarely executed, but are usually sentenced to a
term in prison;
that convicted murderers usually are model prisoners, and that they
almost always become law-abiding citizens upon their release from
prison; that the costs of executing a capital offender exceed the costs
of imprisoning him for life; that while in prison, a convict under
sentence of death performs none of the useful functions that life
prisoners perform; that no attempt is made in the sentencing process to
ferret out likely recidivists for execution; and that the death penalty
may actually stimulate criminal activity.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">This information
would almost surely convince the
average
citizen that the death penalty was unwise, but a problem arises as to
whether it would convince him that the penalty was morally
reprehensible. This problem arises from the fact that the public's
desire for retribution, even though this is a goal that the legislature
cannot constitutionally pursue as its sole justification for capital
punishment, might influence the citizenry's view of the morality of
capital punishment. The solution to the problem lies in the fact that
no one has ever seriously advanced retribution as a legitimate goal of
our society. Defenses of capital punishment are always mounted on
deterrent or other similar theories. This should not be surprising. It
is the people of this country who have urged in the past that prisons
rehabilitate as well as isolate offenders, and it is the people who
have injected a sense of purpose into our penology. I cannot believe
that at this stage in our history, the American people would ever
knowingly support purposeless vengeance. Thus, I believe that the great
mass of citizens would conclude on the basis of the material already
considered that the death penalty is immoral and therefore
unconstitutional.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">But, if this
information needs supplementing, I
believe that the
following facts would serve to convince <font color="#005500">
<a name="364">[408 U.S. 238, 364]
</a>&nbsp;
</font> even the most hesitant of citizens to condemn
death as a
sanction: capital punishment is imposed discriminatorily against
certain identifiable classes of people; there is evidence that innocent
people have been executed before their innocence can be proved; and the
death penalty wreaks havoc with our entire criminal justice system.
Each of these facts is considered briefly below.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Regarding
discrimination, it has been said that
"[i]t is
usually the poor, the illiterate, the underprivileged, the member of
the minority group - the man who, because he is without means, and is
defended by a court-appointed attorney - who becomes society's
sacrificial lamb . . . ."
<a name="t148"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f148">148
</a> Indeed, a look at the bare statistics regarding executions is
enough to betray much of the discrimination. A total of 3,859 persons
have been executed since 1930, of whom 1,751 were white and 2,066 were
Negro.
<a name="t149"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f149">149
</a> Of the executions, 3,334 were for murder; 1,664 of the executed
murderers were white and 1,630 were Negro;
<a name="t150"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f150">150
</a> 455 persons, including 48 whites and 405 Negroes, were executed
for rape.
<a name="t151"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f151">151
</a> It is immediately apparent that Negroes were executed far more
often than whites in proportion to their percentage of the population.
Studies indicate that while the higher rate of execution among Negroes
is partially due to a higher rate of crime, there is evidence of racial
discrimination.
<a name="t152"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f152">152
</a>&nbsp;
<font color="#005500"><a name="365">[408 U.S. 238,
365]
</a>&nbsp;
</font> Racial or other discriminations should not be
surprising. In
McGautha v. California, <a
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?navby=volpage&amp;court=us&amp;vol=402&amp;page=207#207">402
U.S., at 207
</a>, this Court held "that committing to the untrammeled discretion of
the jury the power to pronounce life or death in capital cases is [not]
offensive to anything in the Constitution." This was an open invitation
to discrimination.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">There is also
overwhelming evidence that the death
penalty is
employed against men and not women. Only 32 women have been executed
since 1930, while 3,827 men have met a similar fate.
<a name="t153"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f153">153
</a> It is difficult to understand why women have received such favored
treatment since the purposes allegedly served by capital punishment
seemingly are equally applicable to both sexes.
<a name="t154"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f154">154
</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">It also is evident
that the burden of capital
punishment falls upon
the poor, the ignorant, and the underprivileged <font color="#005500">
<a name="366">[408 U.S. 238, 366]
</a>&nbsp;
</font> members of society.
<a name="t155"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f155">155
</a> It is the poor, and the members of minority groups who are least
able to voice their complaints against capital punishment. Their
impotence leaves them victims of a sanction that the wealthier,
better-represented, just-as-guilty person can escape. So long as the
capital sanction is used only against the forlorn, easily forgotten
members of society, legislators are content to maintain the status quo,
because change would draw attention to the problem and concern might
develop. Ignorance is perpetuated and apathy soon becomes its mate, and
we have today's situation.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Just as Americans
know little about who is executed
and why,
they are unaware of the potential dangers of executing an innocent man.
Our "beyond a reasonable doubt" burden of proof in criminal cases is
intended to protect the innocent, but we know it is not fool-proof.
Various studies have shown that people whose innocence is later
convincingly established are convicted and sentenced to death.
<a name="t156"

</a>&nbsp;
<font color="#005500"><a name="367">[408 U.S. 238,
367]
</a>&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Proving one's
innocence after a jury finding of
guilt is almost
impossible. While reviewing courts are willing to entertain all kinds
of collateral attacks where a sentence of death is involved, they very
rarely dispute the jury's interpretation of the evidence. This is,
perhaps, as it should be. But, if an innocent man has been found
guilty, he must then depend on the good faith of the prosecutor's
office to help him establish his innocence. There is evidence, however,
that prosecutors do not welcome the idea of having convictions, which
they labored hard to secure, overturned, and that their cooperation is
highly unlikely.
<a name="t157"

</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">No matter how
careful courts are, the possibility of
perjured
testimony, mistaken honest testimony, and human error remain all too
real.
<a name="t158"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f158">158
</a> We have no way of <font color="#005500">
<a name="368">[408 U.S. 238, 368]
</a>&nbsp;
</font> judging how many innocent persons have been
executed but we can
be certain that there were some. Whether there were many is an open
question made difficult by the loss of those who were most
knowledgeable about the crime for which they were convicted. Surely
there will be more as long as capital punishment remains part of our
penal law.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">While it is
difficult to ascertain with certainty
the degree to
which the death penalty is discriminatorily imposed or the number of
innocent persons sentenced to die, there is one conclusion about the
penalty that is universally accepted - i. e., it "tends to distort the
course of the criminal law."
<a name="t159"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f159">159
</a> As Mr. Justice Frankfurter said:
</p>
<ul style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
"I am strongly against capital punishment . . . .
When life is
at hazard in a trial, it sensationalizes the whole thing almost
unwittingly; the effect on juries, the Bar, the public, the Judiciary,
I regard as very bad. I think scientifically the claim of deterrence is
not worth much. Whatever proof there may be in my judgment does not
outweigh the social loss due to the inherent sensationalism of a trial
for life." <a name="t160"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f160">160
  </a>&nbsp; <font color="#005500"><a name="369">[408
U.S.
238, 369] </a>&nbsp; </font>
</ul>
<font style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The deleterious
effects of the death penalty are also
felt
otherwise than at trial. For example, its very existence "inevitably
sabotages a social or institutional program of reformation."
<a name="t161"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f161">161
</a> In short "[t]he presence of the death penalty as the keystone of
our penal system bedevils the administration of criminal justice all
the way down the line and is the stumbling block in the path of general
reform and of the treatment of crime and criminals."
<a name="t162"

</a>&nbsp;
</font>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Assuming knowledge
of all the facts presently
available regarding
capital punishment, the average citizen would, in my opinion, find it
shocking to his conscience and sense of justice.
<a name="t163"
 href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=408&amp;invol=238#f163">163

<h3>VII
</h3>
</center>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">To arrive at the
conclusion that the death penalty
violates the
Eighth Amendment, we have had to engage in a long and tedious journey.
The amount of information that we have assembled and sorted is
enormous. <font color="#005500">
<a name="371">[408 U.S. 238, 371]
</a>&nbsp;
</font> Yet, I firmly believe that we have not deviated
in the
slightest from the principles with which we began.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">At a time in our
history when the streets of the
Nation's cities
inspire fear and despair, rather than pride and hope, it is difficult
to maintain objectivity and concern for our fellow citizens. But, the
measure of a country's greatness is its ability to retain compassion in
time of crisis. No nation in the recorded history of man has a greater
tradition of revering justice and fair treatment for all its citizens
in times of turmoil, confusion, and tension than ours. This is a
country which stands tallest in troubled times, a country that clings
to fundamental principles, cherishes its constitutional heritage, and
rejects simple solutions that compromise the values that lie at the
roots of our democratic system.
</p>
<font style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">In striking
down capital punishment, this Court does
not malign
our system of government. On the contrary, it pays homage to it. Only
in a free society could right triumph in difficult times, and could
civilization record its magnificent advancement. In recognizing the
humanity of our fellow beings, we pay ourselves the highest tribute. We
achieve "a major milestone in the long road up from barbarism"

which celebrate their regard for civilization and humanity by shunning
capital punishment.
