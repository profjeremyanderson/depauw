                      Read the entire dialogue because it's not that
                      long and, as in many Socratic dialogues, the
                      argument slowly builds from the beginning. But for
                      our purposes the most important parts are:<br>

        </b>Socrates is in prison. He has been tried for impiety and
        corrupting the youth of Athens. The charges were trumped up;
        nevertheless he was convicted and is awaiting execution.
        (Plato's account of this trial is in the <span
          style="font-style: italic;">Apology</span>, pp. 46-63 of
        CMPT.) Socrates' friend Crito visits him, intending to persuade
        him to escape his death sentence. </p>
      <hr style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;" width="100%">
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[1]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Why have you come at this hour, Crito? It must be
        quite early. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[2]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Yes, certainly. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[3]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: What is the exact time? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[4]&nbsp;
        CRITO: The dawn is breaking. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[5]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: I wonder the keeper of the prison would let you in. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[6]&nbsp;
        CRITO: He knows me because I often come, Socrates; moreover. I
        have done him a kindness. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[7]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: And are you only just come? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[8]&nbsp;
        CRITO: No, I came some time ago. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[9]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Then why did you sit and say nothing, instead of
        awakening me at once? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[10]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Why, indeed, Socrates, I myself would rather not have all
        this sleeplessness and sorrow. But I have been wondering at your
        peaceful slumbers, and that was the reason why I did not awaken
        you, because I wanted you to be out of pain. I have always
        thought you happy in the calmness of your temperament; but never
        did I see the like of the easy, cheerful way in which you bear
        this calamity. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[11]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Why, Crito, when a man has reached my age he ought not
        to be repining at the prospect of death. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[12]&nbsp;
        CRITO: And yet other old men find themselves in similar
        misfortunes, and age does not prevent them from repining. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[13]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: That may be. But you have not told me why you come at
        this early hour. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[14]&nbsp;
        CRITO: I come to bring you a message which is sad and painful;
        not, as I believe, to yourself but to all of us who are your
        friends, and saddest of all to me. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[15]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: What! I suppose that the ship has come from Delos, on
        the arrival of which I am to die? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[16]&nbsp;
        CRITO: No, the ship has not actually arrived, but she will
        probably be here to-day, as persons who have come from Sunium
        tell me that they have left her there; and therefore to-morrow,
        Socrates, will be the last day of your life. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[17]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Very well, Crito; if such is the will of God, I am
        willing; but my belief is that there will be a delay of a day. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[18]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Why do you say this? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[19]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: I will tell you. I am to die on the day after the
        arrival of the ship? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[20]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Yes; that is what the authorities say. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[21]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: But I do not think that the ship will be here until
        to-morrow; this I gather from a vision which I had last night,
        or rather only just now, when you fortunately allowed me to
        sleep. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[22]&nbsp;
        CRITO: And what was the nature of the vision? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[23]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: There came to me the likeness of a woman, fair and
        comely, clothed in white raiment, who called to me and said: O
        Socrates--"The third day hence, to Phthia shalt thou go." </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[24]&nbsp;
        CRITO: What a singular dream, Socrates! </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[25]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: There can be no doubt about the meaning Crito, I
        think. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[26]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Yes: the meaning is only too clear. But, O! my beloved
        Socrates, let me entreat you once more to take my advice and
        escape. For if you die I shall not only lose a friend who can
        never be replaced, but there is another evil: people who do not
        know you and me will believe that I might have saved you if I
        had been willing to give money, but that I did not care. Now,
        can there be a worse disgrace than this --that I should be
        thought to value money more than the life of a friend? For the
        many will not be persuaded that I wanted you toescape, and that
        you refused. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[27]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: But why, my dear Crito, should we care about the
        opinion of the many? Good men, and they are the only persons who
        are worth considering, will think of these things truly as they
        happened. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[28]&nbsp;
        CRITO: But do you see, Socrates, that the opinion of the many
        must be regarded, as is evident in your own case, because they
        can do the very greatest evil to anyone who has lost their good
        opinion. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[29]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: I only wish, Crito, that they could; for then they
        could also do the greatest good, and that would be well. But the
        truth is, that they can do neither good nor evil: they cannot
        make a man wise or make him foolish; and whatever they do is the
        result of chance. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[30]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Well, I will not dispute about that; but please to tell
        me, Socrates, whether you are not acting out of regard to me and
        your other friends: are you not afraid that if you escape hence
        we may get into trouble with the informers for having stolen you
        away, and lose either the whole or a great part of our property;
        or that even a worse evil may happen to us? Now, if this is your
        fear, be at ease; for in order to save you, we ought surely to
        run this or even a greater risk; be persuaded, then, and do as I
        say. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[31]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Yes, Crito, that is one fear which you mention, but by
        no means the only one. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[32]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Fear not. There are persons who at no great cost are
        willing to save you and bring you out of prison; and as for the
        informers, you may observe that they are far from being
        exorbitant in their demands; a little money will satisfy them.
        My means, which, as I am sure, are ample, are at your service,
        and if you have a scruple about spending all mine, here are
        strangers who will give you the use of theirs; and one of them,
        Simmias the Theban, has brought a sum of money for this very
        purpose; and Cebes and many others are willing to spend their
        money too. I say, therefore, do not on that account hesitate
        about making your escape, and do not say, as you did in the
        court, that you will have a difficulty in knowing what to do
        with yourself if you escape. For men will love you in other
        places to which you may go, and not in Athens only; there are
        friends of mine in Thessaly, if you like to go to them, who will
        value and protect you, and no Thessalian will give you any
        trouble. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[33]&nbsp;
        Nor can I think that you are justified, Socrates, in betraying
        your own life when you might be saved; this is playing into the
        hands of your enemies and destroyers; and moreover I should say
        that you were betraying your children; for you might bring them
        up and educate them; instead of which you go away and leave
        them, and they will have to take their chance; and if they do
        not meet with the usual fate of orphans, there will be small
        thanks to you. No man should bring children into the world who
        is unwilling to persevere to the end in their nurture and
        education. But you are choosing the easier part, as I think, not
        the better and manlier, which would rather have become one who
        professes virtue in all his actions, like yourself. And, indeed,
        I am ashamed not only of you, but of us who are your friends,
        when I reflect that this entire business of yours will be
        attributed to our want of courage. The trial need never have
        come on, or might have been brought to another issue; and the
        end of all, which is the crowning absurdity, will seem to have
        been permitted by us, through cowardice and baseness, who might
        have saved you, as you might have saved yourself, if we had been
        good for anything (for there was no difficulty in escaping); and
        we did not see how disgraceful, Socrates, and also miserable all
        this will be to us as well as to you. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[34]&nbsp;
        Make your mind up then, or rather have your mind already made
        up, for the time of deliberation is over, and there is only one
        thing to be done, which must be done, if at all, this very
        night, and which any delay will render all but impossible; I
        beseech you therefore, Socrates, to be persuaded by me, and to
        do as I say. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[35]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Dear Crito, your zeal is invaluable, if a right one;
        but if wrong, the greater the zeal the greater the evil; and
        therefore we ought to consider whether these things shall be
        done or not. For I am and always have been one of those natures
        who must be guided by reason, whatever the reason may be which
        upon reflection appears to me to be the best; and now that this
        fortune has come upon me, I cannot put away the reasons which I
        have before given: the principles which I have hitherto honored
        and revered I still honor, and unless we can find other and
        better principles on the instant, I am certain not to agree with
        you; no, not even if the power of the multitude could inflict
        many more imprisonments, confiscations, deaths, frightening us
        like children with hobgoblin terrors. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[36]&nbsp;
        But what will be the fairest way of considering the question?
        Shall I return to your old argument about the opinions of men?
        some of which are to be regarded, and others, as we were saying,
        are not to be regarded. Now were we right in maintaining this
        before I was condemned? And has the argument which was once good
        now proved to be talk for the sake of talking; in fact an
        amusement only, and altogether vanity? That is what I want to
        consider with your help, Crito: whether, under my present
        circumstances, the argument appears to be in any way different
        or not; and is to be allowed by me or disallowed. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[37]&nbsp;
        That argument, which, as I believe, is mintained by many who
        assume to be authorities, was to the effect, as I was saying,
        that the opinions of some men are to be regarded, and of other
        men not to be regarded. Now you, Crito, are a disinterested
        person who are not going to die to-morrow--at least, there is no
        human probability of this, and you are therefore not liable to
        be deceived by the circumstances in which you are placed. Tell
        me, then, whether I am right in saying that some opinions, and
        the opinions of some men only, are to be valued, and other
        opinions, and the opinions of other men, are not to be valued. I
        ask you whether I was right in maintaining this? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[38]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Certainly. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[39]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: The good are to be regarded, and not the bad? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[40]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Yes. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[41]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: And the opinions of the wise are good, and the
        opinions of the unwise are evil? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[42]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Certainly. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[43]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: And what was said about another matter? Was the
        disciple in gymnastics supposed to attend to the praise and
        blame and opinion of every man, or of one man only--his
        physician or trainer, whoever that was? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[44]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Of one man only. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[45]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: And he ought to fear the censure and welcome the
        praise of that one only, and not of the many? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[46]&nbsp;
        CRITO: That is clear. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[47]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: And he ought to live and train, and eat and drink in
        the way which seems good to his single master who has
        understanding, rather than according to the opinion of all other
        men put together? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[48]&nbsp;
        CRITO: True. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[49]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: And if he disobeys and disregards the opinion and
        approval of the one, and regards the opinion of the many who
        have no understanding, will he not suffer evil? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[50]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Certainly he will. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[51]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: And what will the evil be, whither tending and what
        affecting, in the disobedient person? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[52]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Clearly, affecting the body; that is what is destroyed by
        the evil. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[53]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Very good; and is not this true, Crito, of other
        things which we need not separately enumerate? In the matter of
        just and unjust, fair and foul, good and evil, which are the
        subjects of our present consultation, ought we to follow the
        opinion of the many and to fear them; or the opinion of the one
        man who has understanding, and whom we ought to fear and
        reverence more than all the rest of the world: and whom
        deserting we shall destroy and injure that principle in us which
        may be assumed to be improved by justice and deteriorated by
        injustice; is there not such a principle? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[54]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Certainly there is, Socrates. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[55]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Take a parallel instance: if, acting under the advice
        of men who have no understanding, we destroy that which is
        improvable by health and deteriorated by disease--when that has
        been destroyed, I say, would life be worth having? And that
        is--the body? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[56]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Yes. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[57]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Could we live, having an evil and corrupted body? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[58]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Certainly not. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[59]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: And will life be worth having, if that higher part of
        man be depraved, which is improved by justice and deteriorated
        by injustice? Do we suppose that principle, whatever it may be
        in man, which has to do with justice and injustice, to be
        inferior to the body? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[60]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Certainly not. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[61]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: More honored, then? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[62]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Far more honored. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[63]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Then, my friend, we must not regard what the many say
        of us: but what he, the one man who has understanding of just
        and unjust, will say, and what the truth will say. And therefore
        you begin in error when you suggest that we should regard the
        opinion of the many about just and unjust, good and evil,
        honorable and dishonorable. Well, someone will say, "But the
        many can kill us." </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[64]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Yes, Socrates; that will clearly be the answer. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[65]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: That is true: but still I find with surprise that the
        old argument is, as I conceive, unshaken as ever. And I should
        like to know whether I may say the same of another
        proposition--that not life, but a good life, is to be chiefly
        valued? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[66]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Yes, that also remains. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[67]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: And a good life is equivalent to a just and honorable
        one--that holds also? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[68]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Yes, that holds. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[69]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: From these premises I proceed to argue the question
        whether I ought or ought not to try to escape without the
        consent of the Athenians: and if I am clearly right in escaping,
        then I will make the attempt; but if not, I will abstain. The
        other considerations which you mention, of money and loss of
        character, and the duty of educating children, are, as I hear,
        only the doctrines of the multitude, who would be as ready to
        call people to life, if they were able, as they are to put them
        to death--and with as little reason. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[70]&nbsp;
        But now, since the argument has thus far prevailed, the only
        question which remains to be considered is, whether we shall do
        rightly either in escaping or in suffering others to aid in our
        escape and paying them in money and thanks, or whether we shall
        not do rightly; and if the latter, then death or any other
        calamity which may ensue on my remaining here must not be
        allowed to enter into the calculation. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[71]&nbsp;
        CRITO: I think that you are right, Socrates; how then shall we
        proceed? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[72]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Let us consider the matter together, and do you either
        refute me if you can, and I will be convinced; or else cease, my
        dear friend, from repeating to me that I ought to escape against
        the wishes of the Athenians: for I am extremely desirous to be
        persuaded by you, but not against my own better judgment. And
        now please to consider my first position, and do your best to
        answer me. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[73]&nbsp;
        CRITO: I will do my best. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[74]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Are we to say that we are never intentionally to do
        wrong, or that in one way we ought and in another way we ought
        not to do wrong, or is doing wrong always evil and dishonorable,
        as I was just now saying, and as has been already acknowledged
        by us? Are all our former admissions which were made within a
        few days to be thrown away? And have we, at our age, been
        earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to
        discover that we are no better than children? Or are we to rest
        assured, in spite of the opinion of the many, and in spite of
        consequences whether better or worse, of the truth of what was
        then said, that injustice is always an evil and dishonor to him
        who acts unjustly? Shall we affirm that? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[75]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Yes. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[76]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Then we must do no wrong? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[77]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Certainly not. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[78]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Nor when injured injure in return, as the many
        imagine; for we must injure no one at all? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[79]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Clearly not. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[80]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Again, Crito, may we do evil? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[81]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Surely not, Socrates. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[82]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: And what of doing evil in return for evil, which is
        the morality of the many--is that just or not? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[83]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Not just. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[84]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: For doing evil to another is the same as injuring him?
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[85]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Very true. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[86]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Then we ought not to retaliate or render evil for evil
        to anyone, whatever evil we may have suffered from him. But I
        would have you consider, Crito, whether you really mean what you
        are saying. For this opinion has never been held, and never will
        be held, by any considerable number of persons; and those who
        are agreed and those who are not agreed upon this point have no
        common ground, and can only despise one another when they see
        how widely they differ. Tell me, then, whether you agree with
        and assent to my first principle, that neither injury nor
        retaliation nor warding off evil by evil is ever right. And
        shall that be the premise of our argument? Or do you decline and
        dissent from this? For this has been of old and is still my
        opinion; but, if you are of another opinion, let me hear what
        you have to say. If, however, you remain of the same mind as
        formerly, I will proceed to the next step. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[87]&nbsp;
        CRITO: You may proceed, for I have not changed my mind. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[88]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Then I will proceed to the next step, which may be put
        in the form of a question: Ought a man to do what he admits to
        be right, or ought he to betray the right? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[89]&nbsp;
        CRITO: He ought to do what he thinks right. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[90]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: But if this is true, what is the application? In
        leaving the prison against the will of the Athenians, do I wrong
        any? or rather do I not wrong those whom I ought least to wrong?
        Do I not desert the principles which were acknowledged by us to
        be just? What do you say? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[91]&nbsp;
        CRITO: I cannot tell, Socrates, for I do not know. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[92]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Then consider the matter in this way: Imagine that I
        am about to play truant (you may call the proceeding by any name
        which you like), and the laws and the government come and
        interrogate me: "Tell us, Socrates," they say; "what are you
        about? are you going by an act of yours to overturn us--the laws
        and the whole State, as far as in you lies? Do you imagine that
        a State can subsist and not be overthrown, in which the
        decisions of law have no power, but are set aside and overthrown
        by individuals?" </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[93]&nbsp;
        What will be our answer, Crito, to these and the like words?
        Anyone, and especially a clever rhetorician, will have a good
        deal to urge about the evil of setting aside the law which
        requires a sentence to be carried out; and we might reply, "Yes;
        but the State has injured us and given an unjust sentence."
        Suppose I say that? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[94]&nbsp;
        CRITO: Very good, Socrates. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[95]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: "And was that our agreement with you?" the law would
        say; "or were you to abide by the sentence of the State?" And if
        I were to express astonishment at their saying this, the law
        would probably add: "Answer, Socrates, instead of opening your
        eyes: you are in the habit of asking and answering questions.
        Tell us what complaint you have to make against us which
        justifies you in attempting to destroy us and the State? In the
        first place did we not bring you into existence? Your father
        married your mother by our aid and begat you. Say whether you
        have any objection to urge against those of us who regulate
        marriage?" </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[96]&nbsp;
        None, I should reply. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[97]&nbsp;
        "Or against those of us who regulate the system of nurture and
        education of children in which you were trained? Were not the
        laws, who have the charge of this, right in commanding your
        father to train you in music and gymnastic?" </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[98]&nbsp;
        Right, I should reply. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[99]&nbsp;
        "Well, then, since you were brought into the world and nurtured
        and educated by us, can you deny in the first place that you are
        our child and slave, as your fathers were before you? And if
        this is true you are not on equal terms with us; nor can you
        think that you have a right to do to us what we are doing to
        you. Would you have any right to strike or revile or do any
        other evil to a father or to your master, if you had one, when
        you have been struck or reviled by him, or received some other
        evil at his hands?--you would not say this? And because we think
        right to destroy you, do you think that you have any right to
        destroy us in return, and your country as far as in you lies?
        And will you, O professor of true virtue, say that you are
        justified in this? Has a philosopher like you failed to discover
        that our country is more to be valued and higher and holier far
        than mother or father or any ancestor, and more to be regarded
        in the eyes of the gods and of men of understanding? also to be
        soothed, and gently and reverently entreated when angry, even
        more than a father, and if not persuaded, obeyed? And when we
        are punished by her, whether with imprisonment or stripes, the
        punishment is to be endured in silence; and if she leads us to
        wounds or death in battle, thither we follow as is right;
        neither may anyone yield or retreat or leave his rank, but
        whether in battle or in a court of law, or in any other place,
        he must do what his city and his country order him; or he must
        change their view of what is just: and if he may do no violence
        to his father or mother, much less may he do violence to his
        country." </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[100]&nbsp;
        What answer shall we make to this, Crito? Do the laws speak
        truly, or do they not? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[101]&nbsp;
        CRITO: I think that they do. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[102]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Then the laws will say: "Consider, Socrates, if this
        is true, that in your present attempt you are going to do us
        wrong. For, after having brought you into the world, and
        nurtured and educated you, and given you and every other citizen
        a share in every good that we had to give, we further proclaim
        and give the right to every Athenian, that if he does not like
        us when he has come of age and has seen the ways of the city,
        and made our acquaintance, he may go where he pleases and take
        his goods with him; and none of us laws will forbid him or
        interfere with him. Any of you who does not like us and the
        city, and who wants to go to a colony or to any other city, may
        go where he likes, and take his goods with him. But he who has
        experience of the manner in which we order justice and
        administer the State, and still remains, has entered into an
        implied contract that he will do as we command him. And he who
        disobeys us is, as we maintain, thrice wrong: first, because in
        disobeying us he is disobeying his parents; secondly, because we
        are the authors of his education; thirdly, because he has made
        an agreement with us that he will duly obey our commands; and he
        neither obeys them nor convinces us that our commands are wrong;
        and we do not rudely impose them, but give him the alternative
        of obeying or convincing us; that is what we offer, and he does
        neither. These are the sort of accusations to which, as we were
        saying, you, Socrates, will be exposed if you accomplish your
        intentions; you, above all other Athenians." </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[103]&nbsp;
        Suppose I ask, why is this? they will justly retort upon me that
        I above all other men have acknowledged the agreement. "There is
        clear proof," they will say, "Socrates, that we and the city
        were not displeasing to you. Of all Athenians you have been the
        most constant resident in the city, which, as you never leave,
        you may be supposed to love. For you never went out of the city
        either to see the games, except once when you went to the
        Isthmus, or to any other place unless when you were on military
        service; nor did you travel as other men do. Nor had you any
        curiosity to know other States or their laws: your affections
        did not go beyond us and our State; we were your special
        favorites, and you acquiesced in our government of you; and this
        is the State in which you begat your children, which is a proof
        of your satisfaction. Moreover, you might, if you had liked,
        have fixed the penalty at banishment in the course of the
        trial-the State which refuses to let you go now would have let
        you go then. But you pretended that you preferred death to
        exile, and that you were not grieved at death. And now you have
        forgotten these fine sentiments, and pay no respect to us, the
        laws, of whom you are the destroyer; and are doing what only a
        miserable slave would do, running away and turning your back
        upon the compacts and agreements which you made as a citizen.
        And first of all answer this very question: Are we right in
        saying that you agreed to be governed according to us in deed,
        and not in word only? Is that true or not?" </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[104]&nbsp;
        How shall we answer that, Crito? Must we not agree? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[105]&nbsp;
        CRITO: There is no help, Socrates. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[106]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Then will they not say: "You, Socrates, are breaking
        the covenants and agreements which you made with us at your
        leisure, not in any haste or under any compulsion or deception,
        but having had seventy years to think of them, during which time
        you were at liberty to leave the city, if we were not to your
        mind, or if our covenants appeared to you to be unfair. You had
        your choice, and might have gone either to Lacedaemon or Crete,
        which you often praise for their good government, or to some
        other Hellenic or foreign State. Whereas you, above all other
        Athenians, seemed to be so fond of the State, or, in other
        words, of us her laws (for who would like a State that has no
        laws), that you never stirred out of her: the halt, the blind,
        the maimed, were not more stationary in her than you were. And
        now you run away and forsake your agreements. Not so, Socrates,
        if you will take our advice; do not make yourself ridiculous by
        escaping out of the city." </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[107]&nbsp;
        For just consider, if you transgress and err in this sort of
        way, what good will you do, either to yourself or to your
        friends? That your friends will be driven into exile and
        deprived of citizenship, or will lose their property, is
        tolerably certain; and you yourself, if you fly to one of the
        neighboring cities, as, for example, Thebes or Megara, both of
        which are well-governed cities, will come to them as an enemy,
        Socrates, and their government will be against you, and all
        patriotic citizens will cast an evil eye upon you as a subverter
        of the laws, and you will confirm in the minds of the judges the
        justice of their own condemnation of you. For he who is a
        corrupter of the laws is more than likely to be corrupter of the
        young and foolish portion of mankind. Will you then flee from
        well-ordered cities and virtuous men? and is existence worth
        having on these terms? Or will you go to them without shame, and
        talk to them, Socrates? And what will you say to them? What you
        say here about virtue and justice and institutions and laws
        being the best things among men? Would that be decent of you?
        Surely not. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[108]&nbsp;
        But if you go away from well-governed States to Crito's friends
        in Thessaly, where there is great disorder and license, they
        will be charmed to have the tale of your escape from prison, set
        off with ludicrous particulars of the manner in which you were
        wrapped in a goatskin or some other disguise, and metamorphosed
        as the fashion of runaways is--that is very likely; but will
        there be no one to remind you that in your old age you violated
        the most sacred laws from a miserable desire of a little more
        life? Perhaps not, if you keep them in a good temper; but if
        they are out of temper you will hear many degrading things; you
        will live, but how?--as the flatterer of all men, and the
        servant of all men; and doing what?--eating and drinking in
        Thessaly, having gone abroad in order that you may get a dinner.
        And where will be your fine sentiments about justice and virtue
        then? Say that you wish to live for the sake of your children,
        that you may bring them up and educate them--will you take them
        into Thessaly and deprive them of Athenian citizenship? Is that
        the benefit which you would confer upon them? Or are you under
        the impression that they will be better cared for and educated
        here if you are still alive, although absent from them; for that
        your friends will take care of them? Do you fancy that if you
        are an inhabitant of Thessaly they will take care of them, and
        if you are an inhabitant of the other world they will not take
        care of them? </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[109]&nbsp;
        Nay; but if they who call themselves friends are truly friends,
        they surely will. "Listen, then, Socrates, to us who have
        brought you up. Think not of life and children first, and of
        justice afterwards, but of justice first, that you may be
        justified before the princes of the world below. For neither
        will you nor any that belong to you be happier or holier or
        juster in this life, or happier in another, if you do as Crito
        bids. Now you depart in innocence, a sufferer and not a doer of
        evil; a victim, not of the laws, but of men. But if you go
        forth, returning evil for evil, and injury for injury, breaking
        the covenants and agreements which you have made with us, and
        wronging those whom you ought least to wrong, that is to say,
        yourself, your friends, your country, and us, we shall be angry
        with you while you live, and our brethren, the laws in the world
        below, will receive you as an enemy; for they will know that you
        have done your best to destroy us. Listen, then, to us and not
        to Crito." </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[110]&nbsp;
        This is the voice which I seem to hear murmuring in my ears,
        like the sound of the flute in the ears of the mystic; that
        voice, I say, is humming in my ears, and prevents me from
        hearing any other. And I know that anything more which you may
        say will be in vain. Yet speak, if you have anything to say. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[111]&nbsp;
        CRITO: I have nothing to say, Socrates. </p>
      <p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">[112]&nbsp;
        SOCRATES: Then let me follow the intimations of the will of God.
