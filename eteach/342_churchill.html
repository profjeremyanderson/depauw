                      of an essay Churchill wrote in the aftermath of
                      the September 11th attacks. The full essay is
                      available <a

                      <br>
                      Before reading this, it may be helpful to think
                      back to the attacks and imagine what your reaction
                      to Churchill's essay would have been if you had
                      read it the next day.<br>
                      <br>
                      The essay did not receive wide notice until 2005.
                      Then, Churchill was reviled and suffered a series
                      of consequences for it: speaking engagements were
                      cancelled, people demanded that he be fired from
                      his position as a tenured professor at the
                      University of Colorado, and he became fodder for
                      right-wing pundits. Although he could not be fired
                      simply for saying controversial things, an
                      investigation was made into the quality of his
                      scholarship which allegedly revealed instances of
                      plagiarism and other forms of academic misconduct.
                      For these, he was fired in July 2007. <br>

              queried by reporters concerning his views on the
              assassination of John F. Kennedy in November 1963, Malcolm
              X famously &#8211; and quite charitably, all things considered &#8211;
              replied that it was merely a case of &#8220;chickens coming home
              to roost.&#8221;<br>
              <br>
              On the morning of September 11, 2001, a few more chickens
              &#8211; along with some half-million dead Iraqi children &#8211; came
              home to roost in a very big way at the twin towers of New
              York&#8217;s World Trade Center. Well, actually, a few of them
              seem to have nestled in at the Pentagon as well.<br>
              <br>
              The Iraqi youngsters, all of them under 12, died as a
              predictable &#8211; in fact, widely predicted &#8211; result of the
              1991 US &#8220;surgical&#8221; bombing of their country&#8217;s water
              purification and sewage facilities, as well as other
              &#8220;infrastructural&#8221; targets upon which Iraq&#8217;s civilian

              <br>
              Of the [9/11/01 hijackers], there are a few things
              demanding to be said in the face of the unending torrent
              of disinformational drivel unleashed by George Junior and
              the corporate &#8220;news&#8221; media immediately following their
              successful operation on September 11. <br>
              <br>
              They did not, for starters, &#8220;initiate&#8221; a war with the US,
              much less commit &#8220;the first acts of war of the new
              millennium.&#8221; <br>
              <br>
              A good case could be made that the war in which they were
              combatants has been waged more-or-less continuously by the
              &#8220;Christian West&#8221; &#8211; now proudly emblematized by the United
              States &#8211; against the &#8220;Islamic East&#8221; since the time of the
              First Crusade, about 1,000 years ago. More recently, one
              could argue that the war began when Lyndon Johnson first
              lent significant support to Israel&#8217;s
              dispossession/displacement of Palestinians during the
              1960s, or when George the Elder ordered &#8220;Desert Shield&#8221; in
              1990, or at any of several points in between. Any way you
              slice it, however, if what the combat teams did to the WTC
              and the Pentagon can be understood as acts of war &#8211; and
              they can &#8211; then the same is true of every US &#8220;overflight&#8217;
              of Iraqi territory since day one. The first acts of war
              during the current millennium thus occurred on its very
              first day, and were carried out by U.S. aviators acting
              under orders from their then-commander-in-chief, Bill
              Clinton. The most that can honestly be said of those
              involved on September 11 is that they finally responded in
              kind to some of what this country has dispensed to their
              people as a matter of course.<br>
              <br>
              That they waited so long to do so is, notwithstanding the
              1993 action at the WTC, more than anything a testament to
              their patience and restraint.<br>
              <br>
              They did not license themselves to &#8220;target innocent
              civilians.&#8221; <br>
              <br>
              There is simply no argument to be made that the Pentagon
              personnel killed on September 11 fill that bill. The
              building and those inside comprised military targets, pure
              and simple. As to those in the World Trade Center . . .<br>
              <br>
              Well, really. Let&#8217;s get a grip here, shall we? True
              enough, they were civilians of a sort. But innocent? Gimme
              a break. They formed a technocratic corps at the very
              heart of America&#8217;s global financial empire &#8211; the &#8220;mighty
              engine of profit&#8221; to which the military dimension of U.S.
              policy has always been enslaved &#8211; and they did so both
              willingly and knowingly. Recourse to &#8220;ignorance&#8221; &#8211; a
              derivative, after all, of the word &#8220;ignore&#8221; &#8211; counts as
              less than an excuse among this relatively well-educated
              elite. To the extent that any of them were unaware of the
              costs and consequences to others of what they were
              involved in &#8211; and in many cases excelling at &#8211; it was
              because of their absolute refusal to see. More likely, it
              was because they were too busy braying, incessantly and
              self-importantly, into their cell phones, arranging power
              lunches and stock transactions, each of which translated,
              conveniently out of sight, mind and smelling distance,
              into the starved and rotting flesh of infants. If there
              was a better, more effective, or in fact any other way of
              visiting some penalty befitting their participation upon
              the little Eichmanns* inhabiting the sterile sanctuary of
              the twin towers, I&#8217;d really be interested in hearing about
              it.<br>

                Eichmann</a>, who worked for the Nazi regime. After
              World War II Eichmann was tried by Israel for his
              contribution to the mass murder of European Jews. His
              trial was famously discussed in Hannah Arendt's book, <span
                style="font-style: italic;">Eichmann in Jerusalem</span>.
              According to Arendt, the Israeli prosecutors tried to
              portray Eichmann as a powerful and malicious monster.
              However, Arendt argued that he was in fact just a boring
              bureaucrat--one who did not think much about the harm he
              was contributing to, but rather just saw himself as doing
              his job as best he could. By referring to the WTC workers
              as "little Eichmanns" Churchill is suggesting that they,
              too, thoughtlessly contributed to terrible harms to
              others. The phrase "little Eichmanns" has a bit more
              history to it, which can be pursued in <a target="_blank"
