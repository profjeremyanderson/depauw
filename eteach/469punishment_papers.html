                semester you will write two short essays. </font><font
                size="-1">Each will be 1000-1500 words (that is, roughly
                3-5 pages) long</font><font size="-1">. <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">In each, critically
                  evaluate some of the material we have studied. </span><br>
                <br>
              </font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">To
                  do this effectively in a short space you will need to
                  limit the scope of your essay. </span>Take on a small
                question rather than a large one. For example, do not
                try to show that retributivism is superior to
                consequentialism, or determine whether consequentialism
                indeed does require harming the innocent sometimes.
                (These would be tough to do even in your longer research
                essay.) It might also be too much to take on the
                argument of an entire text. <br>
                <br>
                For example, Igor Primorac's article "Utilitarianism and
                the Punishment of the Innocent" provides several
                different arguments. Discussing all of them would be too
                much to take on in a short paper. Instead, choose some
                particular argument in a text. For example, within
                "Utilitarianism and the Punishment of the Innocent," you
                could discuss one particular argument Primorac makes, or
                discuss whether Rawls's position (which Primorac is
                criticizing) is really vulnerable to Primorac's
                critique. Or you might set aside the question of whether
                an author's <span style="font-style: italic;">conclusion




                </span>is correct and focus more on the quality of an <span

              <font size="-1">One place to look for potential topics is

First,

a
brief
introduction

















                    with your thesis and a road map. </span>In your
                  introduction, state your thesis -- the overall
                  conclusion that you are going to argue for. Then
                  briefly summarize the outline of your paper -- that
                  is, the main steps you will take to argue for your
                  thesis, in the order you will make them. Think of this
                  as a road map of your paper. Resist the temptation to
                  do much more than this in your introduction. The intro
                  for a short paper should be no more than half a page;
                  the intro for the long paper no more than a page. <br>

                    style="font-weight: bold;">Organize your paper as an
                    argument: </span>a series of statements which,
                  taken together, logically imply a conclusion. Your
                  thesis is the overall conclusion, and each paragraph
                  should make a point which clearly contributes to the
                  argument for your thesis. The sentences in each
                  paragraph, then, should explain and/or support that
                  paragraph's point. I will expect the paper to proceed
                  according to the road map given in the introduction.</font><br
