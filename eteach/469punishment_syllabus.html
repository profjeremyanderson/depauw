            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">The belief
                that <span style="font-style: italic;">crimes should be
                  punished </span>is so deeply ingrained that to
                question it may seem nutty. But it is ripe for
                philosophical examination. One of the starkest exercises
                of governments&#8217; power is the threat and practice of
                legal punishment. Thus, insofar as government itself
                requires justification, legal punishment requires it all
                the more. Further, if it is true (as some political
                theorists hold) that effective government requires the
                power to punish, then the basis for government itself
                might be called into question if punishment cannot be
                justified. Punishment&#8217;s justification is important,
                then. But it is also problematic. When we punish we do
                things that, under other circumstances, are morally
                wrong and illegal: lock people up against their will,
                take away their property, deprive them of various rights
                such as the right to vote or free association, or we
                kill them. The purpose of this course is to critically
                examine justifications offered for legal punishment and
                alternatives to it. We will delve into the long-standing
                and complex debate over whether and how punishment may
                be justified, and consider relevant empirical
                data.&nbsp; </font><br>
