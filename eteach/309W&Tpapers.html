                  rather than expository. It should defend a conclusion
                  which other smart people might well disagree with.
                  This should be your paper's major focus; there should
                  be no more background material than is necessary to
                  explain and give perspective to the arguments you

                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your paper's
                  conclusions should not depend on mere expressions of
                  personal opinion or armchair arguments. It is not

introduction


















                    which includes a thesis and road map. </span>Your
                  thesis is the overall conclusion your paper will argue
                  for; state it up front and clearly. Also give a road
                  map to your paper--i.e., briefly summarize the the
                  main steps you will take to support your thesis, in
                  the order you will make them. Resist the temptation to
                  do much more than this in your introduction. The intro
                  for a short paper should be no more than half a page;
                  the intro for a long paper no more than a page. <br>

                    argument: </span>a series of statements which,
                  taken together, logically imply a conclusion. Your
                  thesis is the overall conclusion, and each paragraph
                  should make a point which contributes to the argument
                  for your thesis. The sentences in each paragraph,
                  then, should explain and/or support that paragraph's
                  point. I will expect the paper to proceed according to
                  the road map given in the introduction.</font><br

                  do this effectively in a short space you will need to
                  limit the scope of your essay. Take on a small
                  question rather than a large one. </span>For example,
                do not try to show that realism is preferable to
                pacifism, or that humanitarian intervention is always
                wrong. (These would be challenging to do even in your
                long paper.) It might also be too much to take on the
                argument of an entire text. For example, Reader's
                "Making Pacifism Plausible" presents arguments regarding
                war-ism, having a war-machine, the justifiability of
                killing in war, and hit squads. That is too much to take
                on in a short paper. Instead, I recommend choosing some
                particular argument in a text. For example, is Reader's
                argument that self-defense cannot justify killing in war
                sound? How effective is Jones' rebuttal to Bush's
                argument for invading Iraq? Or you might set aside the
                question of whether an author's <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">conclusion </span>is
                correct and focus more on the quality of an <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">argument</span>,
                critically evaluating it.<br>

              <font size="-1">One place to look for potential topics is
                in your own reading responses: what portion of the
                readings has most intrigued you? Is there a particular
                argument or issue you want to write about? Consider the
                cases we have read about in Walzer. Do you think Walzer
                came to the right conclusion regarding a given case?
                Consider some case we have read about in news articles:
                fleeing Iraqi soldiers, or shooting the boys who picked
                up a weapon, or designing ordnance to wound, or another.
                Do the actions depicted accord with the rules of just
                war? What does that tell us? Feel free to discuss
                possible topics with me.</font><br>
