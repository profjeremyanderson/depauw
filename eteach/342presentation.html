            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight:
                bold;">Here's what the syllabus says</span><br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">The presentation will
                entail you forming small groups of 2 or 3 if the class
                is large, or working alone or in pairs if the class is
                small. ...Each individual/group will take responsibility
                for researching a topic within the philosophy of law and
                presenting it to the class. Your presentations are part
                of the course (their contents will be fair game for the
                final exam, for example), so they need to be done well,
                and I will help you do well. I can suggest presentation
                topics, but it's best if you choose what interests you.<br>
              </div>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Here's some more detail:</span><br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">During the course I help
                guide you through a bunch of topics in the philosophy of
                law: criminal law, tort law, constitutional law,
                excuses, punishment, Shimp, David Cash, interpretation,
                legal moralism, executing dogs, blah, blah, blah. Most
                of these issues have been covered only superficially in
                class, however, and you might want to understand one of
                them in more depth. Or you might want to explore
                something very different. Fine! You will need to pick
                something of interest to you, find a fellow student or
                two with similar interests and form your own groups of
                2-3 people, get me to approve your topic (which is
                easy), research your topic, and present what you have
                learned to the class.<br>
                <br>
                If you don't already have a topic in mind, there are
                many places to seek inspiration. Consider what brought
                you into the class: is there some topic or problem in
                law or public policy you wanted to explore? Some
                real-life event you want to examine and discuss? Think
                about your major: how in what ways does it connect with
                philosophy of law? In our textbook, look at the study
                questions for each section, the footnotes at the end of
                many of the articles, and articles and cases we haven't
                read. Look at the <a href="342papers.html#topics">topics




















                  listed at the bottom of the Papers page</a>, and your
                and others' reading responses. <a
                  href="342home.html#contact">Come see me</a> to discuss
                your interests. <br>
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
                  Most important: pick a topic that interests you. </span><br>
                <br>
                The class will need to do some prep work for
                presentations as well. You'll create an assignment to
                prepare the class for your presentation. The assignment
                could be a court case or excerpt from one, some news
                article(s), a scholarly article, and/or video or other
                media. It should help us all become familiar with the
                topic and some of its key issues, and thereby enhance
                discussion. Since these will be assignments, responses
                to them will be required -- and count -- just like all
                other reading responses in the course.<br>

                e-mail me to let me know who is in your group, and give

              <br>
              The sooner you clear your topic and group with me, the
              better the choice of dates you'll have (not to mention
              having more time to prep), so I encourage you to form
              groups (if the class is large) and notify me of topics
              sooner. <br>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Good research is vital to
              your success. Learn as much as you can about your topic to
              present it effectively to a group of people who are as
              smart and critical as you are. <br>
              <br>
              Materials assigned in this course don't count as research.
              While you may refer to them in your work--and it can be
              good to relate what you're doing to what we've already
              discussed--your work should mostly or entirely come from
              other sources.<br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Getting started</span><br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight:

                with me at least twice to discuss your plans.<br>
                <br>
                Identify the names of any <span style="font-style:
                  italic;">people </span>and/or the <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">topics </span>you are
                writing about. Then, look for general information about
                them from reference sources such as <a
href="https://profjeremyanderson.github.io/depauw/phil_links.html#encyclopedias">encyclopedias</a>.
                Using the info from reference sources, (including the
                bibliographies they provide), look for more key terms
                and names related to your topic. Use the <a

                  href="http://www.depauw.edu/libraries/">Library

                  href="https://libcal.depauw.edu/appointments">reference




















                  librarians</a>, and and databases to find scholarly
                material on your topic. (Here are <a target="_blank"
                  href="https://libguides.depauw.edu/az.php">all the

                  Scholar</a> is good, too, and has the familiar Google
                interface. (Generally avoid plain Google; too much
                garbage there.)<br>
                <br>
                As you go, look for things that might be good to assign
                to the class. <br>
              </div>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Choose your sources

              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">First, don't look in just
                one place. You may miss some really good stuff. So yes,
                use JSTOR, but also use the Library's search, Google
                Scholar, the Philosopher's Index, etc. <br>
                <br>
                Second, be choosy about the quality of your
                sources:&nbsp; <br>

                    obvious bias, or by authors with unknown
                    qualifications or no qualifications. Relying on

                    start your research, but they had better not be
                    where it ends (especially Wikipedia, since some of
                    its articles are just abysmal and its overall
                    quality is unreliable). In other words,
                    encyclopedia-type sources are good to orient
                    yourself to your subject and to find leads to other
                    and better sources of information, but relying much
                    on such sources for your presentation may count

              Include something that involves the class in your
              presentation: an exercise, activity, etc. Have questions
              prepared for the class to get discussion going and keep it
              going. <br>
              <br>
              Visual aids (writing on the board, creating posters, doing
              PowerPoint presentations, etc.) are encouraged. Handouts
              which summarize the main points or arguments are strongly
              encouraged. <br>

              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Note to Macintosh users:
                if you prepare a PowerPoint using your Mac it might not
                look right when played using a PC such as the computers
                in our tech classrooms, or a partner's laptop. So you
                should either prepare PowerPoints using a PC or make
                sure you have the video adapter necessary to hook up
                your Mac laptop to the video cable in our classroom.<br>

              Present more than one side of an issue, and be fair about
              it. By "fair" I do not mean making all sides look equally
              good; I mean not presenting any view or argument as less
              (or more) good than it really is. Philosophy is, after
              all, a search for truth, not merely an attempt to win a
              point. You may take a side if you wish, but not by
              misrepresenting or ignoring opposition.<br>

                should document sources, too. Turn them in, with sources

                <br>
                Endnotes are one good way to document sources: put a
                bibliography on the last slide(s) and number each item
                on it. Then, for each item in your slides that comes

                  Academic Integrity Policy</a> applies to this
                assignment. Your documentation -- personal, and slides
                etc. -- must include all the sources you relied on in
                any way whether you quote them or not. <br>
                <br>
                Presenting work done outside this course (for example,
                work already submitted for credit in this or another
                course, or done for some extracurricular activity) is
                not allowed. Having a portion of your presentation
                consist of work done elsewhere might be OK, but discuss
                it with me beforehand. Any work done outside this
                course, if you are allowed to use it at all, must also
                be documented.<br>
                <br>
                Failing to document any source will automatically harm
                your grade and may be charged as plagiarism, even if it
                is accidental. Keep track of your sources!<br>

              substantial, new work by each person.&nbsp; Just
              downloading a web page and reading it to the class or
              copying it onto a PowerPoint slide, for example, is not
              acceptable. You need to show that you've done
              significantly more with the information than merely
              acquiring it.<br>
              <br>
              Here is a guide to what makes better presentations better.
              Your work will be evaluated along the parameters given in
              the table below. If you have taken a lower-division course
              from me you may have seen a similar table before, but that
              does not mean you will get the same grade for the same
              quality of work here. Because this course is
              upper-division my standards will be substantially higher.
