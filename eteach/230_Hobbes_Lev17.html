                    [1] The final cause, end, or design of men, (who
                    naturally love liberty, and dominion over others,)
                    in the introduction of that restraint upon
                    themselves, (in which we see them live in
                    commonwealths,) is the foresight of their own
                    preservation, and of a more contented life thereby;
                    that is to say, of getting themselves out from that
                    miserable condition of war, which is necessarily
                    consequent (as hath been shown), to the natural
                    passions of men, when there is no visible power to
                    keep them in awe, and tie them by fear of punishment
                    to the performance of their covenants, and
                    observation of those laws of nature set down in the
                    fourteenth and fifteenth chapters.<br>
                    <br>
                    [2] For the laws of nature (as <span
                      style="font-style: italic;">justice</span>, <span
                      style="font-style: italic;">equity</span>, <span
                      style="font-style: italic;">modesty</span>, <span
                      style="font-style: italic;">mercy</span>, and (in
                    sum) <span style="font-style: italic;">doing to
                      others, as we would be done to</span>,) of
                    themselves, without the terror of some power, to
                    cause them to be observed, are contrary to our
                    natural passions, that carry us to partiality,
                    pride, revenge, and the like. And covenants, without
                    the sword, are but words, and of no strength to
                    secure a man at all. Therefore notwithstanding the
                    laws of nature, (which every one hath then kept,
                    when he has the will to keep them, when he can do it
                    safely,) if there be no power erected, or not great
                    enough for our security; every man will, and may
                    lawfully rely on his own strength and art, for
                    caution against all other men. And in all places,
                    where men have lived by small families, to rob and
                    spoil one another, has been a trade, and so far from
                    being reputed against the law of nature, that the
                    greater spoils they gained, the greater was their
                    honour; and men observed no other laws therein, but
                    the laws of honour; that is, to abstain from
                    cruelty, leaving to men their lives, and instruments
                    of husbandry. And as small families did then; so now
                    do cities and kingdoms which are but greater
                    families (for their own security) enlarge their
                    dominions, upon all pretences of danger, and fear of
                    invasion, or assistance that may be given to
                    invaders, endeavour as much as they can, to subdue,
                    or weaken their neighbours, by open force, and
                    secret arts, for want of other caution, justly; and
                    are remembered for it in after ages with honour.<br>
                    <br>
                    [3] Nor is it the joining together of a small number
                    of men, that gives them this security; because in
                    small numbers, small additions on the one side or
                    the other, make the advantage of strength so great,
                    as is sufficient to carry the victory; and therefore
                    gives encouragement to an invasion. The multitude
                    sufficient to confide in for our security, is not
                    determined by any certain number, but by comparison
                    with the enemy we fear; and is then sufficient, when
                    the odds of the enemy is not of so visible and
                    conspicuous moment, to determine the event of war,
                    as to move him to attempt.<br>
                    <br>
                    [4] And be there never so great a multitude; yet if
                    their actions be directed according to their
                    particular judgments, and particular appetites, they
                    can expect thereby no defence, nor protection,
                    neither against a common enemy, nor against the
                    injuries of one another. For being distracted in
                    opinions concerning the best use and application of
                    their strength, they do not help, but hinder one
                    another; and reduce their strength by mutual
                    opposition to nothing: whereby they are easily, not
                    only subdued by a very few that agree together; but
                    also when there is no common enemy, they make war
                    upon each other, for their particular interests. For
                    if we could suppose a great multitude of men to
                    consent in the observation of justice, and other
                    laws of nature, without a common power to keep them
                    all in awe; we might as well suppose all mankind to
                    do the same; and then there neither would be, nor
                    need to be any civil government, or commonwealth at
                    all; because there would be peace without
                    subjection.<br>
                    <br>
                    [5] Nor is it enough for the security, which men
                    desire should last all the time of their life, that
                    they be governed, and directed by one judgment, for
                    a limited time; as in one battle, or one war. For
                    though they obtain a victory by their unanimous
                    endeavour against a foreign enemy; yet afterwards,
                    when either they have no common enemy, or he that by
                    one part is held for an enemy, is by another part
                    held for a friend, they must needs by the difference
                    of their interests dissolve, and fall again into a
                    war amongst themselves.<br>
                    <br>
                    [6] It is true, that certain living creatures, as
                    bees, and ants, live sociably one with another,
                    (which are therefore by <span style="font-style:
                      italic;">Aristotle </span>numbered amongst
                    political creatures;) and yet have no other
                    direction, than their particular judgments and
                    appetites; nor speech, whereby one of them can
                    signify to another, what he thinks expedient for the
                    common benefit: and therefore some man may perhaps
                    desire to know, why mankind cannot do the same. To
                    which I answer,<br>
                    <br>
                    [7] First, that men are continually in competition
                    for honour and dignity, which these creatures are
                    not; and consequently amongst men there ariseth on
                    that ground, envy and hatred, and finally war; but
                    amongst these not so.<br>
                    <br>
                    [8] Secondly, that amongst these creatures, the
                    common good differeth not from the private; and
                    being by nature inclined to their private, they
                    procure thereby the common benefit. But man, whose
                    joy consisteth in comparing himself with other men,
                    can relish nothing but what is eminent.<br>
                    <br>
                    [9] Thirdly, that these creatures, having not, (as
                    man) the use of reason, do not see, nor think they
                    see any fault, in the administration of their common
                    business; whereas amongst men, there are very many,
                    that think themselves wiser, and abler to govern the
                    public, better than the rest; and these strive to
                    reform and innovate, one this way, another that way;
                    and thereby bring it into distraction and civil war.<br>
                    <br>
                    [10] Fourthly, that these creatures, though they
                    have some use of voice, in making known to one
                    another their desires, and other affections; yet
                    they want that art of words, by which some men can
                    represent to others, that which is good, in the
                    likeness of evil; and evil, in the likeness of good;
                    and augment, or diminish the apparent greatness of
                    good and evil; discontenting men, and troubling
                    their peace at their pleasure.<br>
                    <br>
                    [11] Fifthly, irrational creatures cannot
                    distinguish between injury, and damage; and
                    therefore as long as they be at ease, they are not
                    offended with their fellows: whereas man is then
                    most troublesome, when he is most at ease: for then
                    it is that he loves to shew his wisdom, and control
                    the actions of them that govern the commonwealth.<br>
                    <br>
                    [12] Lastly, the agreement of these creatures is
                    natural; that of men, is by covenant only, which is
                    artificial: and therefore it is no wonder if there
                    be somewhat else required (besides covenant) to make
                    their agreement constant and lasting; which is a
                    common power, to keep them in awe, and to direct
                    their actions to the common benefit.<br>
                    <br>
                    [13] The only way to erect such a common power, as
                    may be able to defend them from the invasion of
                    foreigners, and the injuries of one another, and
                    thereby to secure them in such sort, as that by
                    their own industry, and by the fruits of the earth,
                    they may nourish themselves and live contentedly;
                    is, to confer all their power and strength upon one
                    man, or upon one assembly of men, that may reduce
                    all their wills, by plurality of voices, unto one
                    will: which is as much as to say, to appoint one
                    man, or assembly of men, to bear their person; and
                    every one to own, and acknowledge himself to be
                    author of whatsoever he that so beareth their
                    person, shall act, or cause to be acted, in those
                    things which concern the common peace and safety;
                    and therein to submit their wills, every one to his
                    will, and their judgments, to his judgment. This is
                    more than consent, or concord; it is a real unity of
                    them all, in one and the same person, made by
                    covenant of every man with every man, in such
                    manner, as if every man should say to every man, <span
                      style="font-style: italic;">I authorise and give
                      up my right of governing myself, to this man, or
                      to this assembly of men, on this condition, that
                      thou give up thy right to him, and authorize all
                      his actions in like manner</span>. This done, the
                    multitude so united in one person, is called a
                    COMMONWEALTH, in Latin CIVITAS. This is the
                    generation of that great LEVIATHAN, or rather (to
                    speak more reverently) of that <span
                      style="font-style: italic;">mortal god</span>, to
                    which we owe under the <span style="font-style:
                      italic;">immortal God</span>, our peace and
                    defence. For by this authority, given him by every
                    particular man in the commonwealth, he hath the use
                    of so much power and strength conferred on him, that
                    by terror thereof, he is enabled to form the wills
                    of them all, to peace at home, and mutual aid
                    against their enemies abroad. And in him consisteth
                    the essence of the commonwealth; which (to define
                    it,) is <span style="font-style: italic;">one
                      person, of whose acts a great multitude, by mutual
                      covenants one with another, have made themselves
                      every one the author, to the end he may use the
                      strength and means of them all, as he shall think
                      expedient, for their peace and common defence</span>.<br>
                    <br>
                    [14] And he that carrieth this person, is called
                    SOVEREIGN, and said to have sovereign power; and
                    every one besides, his SUBJECT.<br>
                    <br>
                    [15] The attaining to this sovereign power, is by
                    two ways. One, by natural force; as when a man
                    maketh his children, to submit themselves, and their
                    children to his government, as being able to destroy
                    them if they refuse; or by war subdueth his enemies
                    to his will, giving them their lives on that
                    condition. The other, is when men agree amongst
                    themselves, to submit to some man, or assembly of
                    men, voluntarily, on confidence to be protected by
                    him against all others. This latter, may be called a
                    political commonwealth, or commonwealth by <span
                      style="font-style: italic;">institution; </span>and
                    the former, a commonwealth by <span
                      style="font-style: italic;">acquisition</span>.
                    And first, I shall speak of a commonwealth by
                    institution.</font></div>
