            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Through reading, discussing,
              and writing about our assigned texts, I want to acquaint
              you with some of the most important discussions in ethics
              (aka moral philosophy), such as: What basis, if any, do
              ethical rules have? What is the point of being ethical?
              How should we tell right from wrong? You will learn about
              and critically evaluate some major schools of ethical
              thought, including consequentialist, deontological, and
              virtue ethics. By the end of the course you should have a
              critical appreciation for all of these and be able to
              employ these kinds of ethical reasoning. In writing and
              presentations, you will practice articulating and
              evaluating complex ideas. These skills in critical
              thinking and writing are valuable in any discipline.<br>

              <br>
              To put the above in other, albeit plodding, words,
              students will be able to:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>Understand and summarize a range of philosophical
                  texts in ethics. </li>
                <li>Identify important thinkers in ethics and their
                  views, and major schools of ethical thought:
                  consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics.</li>
                <li>Explain how those thinkers argue for their views. </li>
                <li>Critically evaluate the arguments those thinkers and
                  others (e.g., me, other students) give.</li>
                <li>Demonstrate your grasp of the above in reading
                  responses, papers, exams, discussion, and
                  presentations.</li>
                <li>Research a topic in ethics independently and
                  effectively present what you learn to the class.</li>
              </ul>

                up to one point per class meeting (i.e., three points
                per normal week). The best form is participating in
                class discussions, but it could also consist of
                discussing course-related things with me outside of
                class in person or by e-mail, written online responses
                to class discussions or presentations, etc. I'm afraid
                mere attendance, looking thoughtful, taking notes, etc.
                do not count. Participating once per week, by whatever
                means, will earn you a B for participation; seventeen
                points (with at least one per week) earns an A+.<br>

                entail you forming small groups; 2-3 members is ideal.
                More details are posted <a href="230presentation.html">on


































                  the Presentations page</a>, but here is a quick
                description. Each group will present some topic within
                ethics to the class. Your group will also give the class
                an assignment to prepare and write reading responses to.
                You will research your topic, finding credible sources
                which give a range of perspectives on it, and include
                those perspectives in your presentation. You may cover a
                reading which responds to something we have already
                covered (for example, a response to Mill or on moral
                relativism), or discuss something entirely new. <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">The key is to find
                  something that interests you. </span>For topic ideas
                and possible reading assignments, there is a vast
                literature available via the Library, and of course you
                can talk with me.<br>

                <br>
                Each assignment includes some reading questions. Asking
                you to write answers to all of them would be too
                demanding. So I ask that you answer <span

                do it <span style="font-style: italic;">regularly</span>.
                Here's what I mean by "regularly" and "some": at least
                once per week, write a response to at least one reading

                  If you find these instructions confusing, my
                  apologies! Let me explain a different way:<br>
                  <br>
                  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">To do <span
                      style="font-style: italic;">one passing reading
                      response</span>, try answering one reading
                    question. If your answer is at least 200 words and
                    it meets the other criteria in the assignment (on
                    time, answers the question thoughtfully, meets the
                    requirements for <a href="230papers.html#integrity">integrity</a>
                    and proofreading) it gets credit for one reading
                    response. If it's not at least 200 words, try
                    answering another question until you've got at least
                    200 words total. But no matter how many of that
                    assignment's questions you answer, it's still just
                    one reading response.<br>
                    <br>
                    To get an A+ for the assignment, you need 16 passing
                    responses. There are 15 weeks of class. So, doing
                    more than one passing response per week would be
                    more than you need. All you need to do is turn in
                    one per week and, in some weeks, turn in more than
                    one, and see to it you total 16 passing responses by
                    the last week of class.<br>

              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">To enable class
                interaction, class will be taught synchronously if
                possible, meeting via video conference during the hours
                in the schedule of classes. This means we will be
                virtually visiting people's living spaces. Class
                meetings will be recorded to serve as a learning
                resource for the class. To respect your classmates, me,
                and those you live with:<br>
                <ul>
                  <li> Do not share those recordings or any portion of
                    them outside the class. </li>
                  <li> Keep your camera on. (If this won't work for you,
                    please see me to talk about it.)</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li> There are advantages to having cameras on.
                      Having faces visible enables lip-reading and
                      interpreting facial expressions, which help us
                      better understand each other. <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>You can prevent others from seeing your living
                      space by using a background image or blurred
                      background.</li>
                    <li>Mind what your camera shows to others. For
                      example, liquor bottles visible in an underage
                      student's dorm room could be a problem. So could
                      racist or otherwise offensive posters or
                      paraphernalia in the background. Let's avoid that.

              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Reading is an act of
                contemplation, perhaps the only act in which we allow
                ourselves to merge with the consciousness of another
                human being. We possess the books we read, animating the
                waiting stillness of their language, but they possess us
                also, filling us with thoughts and observations, asking
                us to make them part of ourselves.... In order for this
                to work, however, we need a certain type of silence, an
                ability to filter out the noise.<br>

              Make time, in a quiet space, to read. Not just once, not
              quickly like it&#8217;s a news article, but deeply. Turn off
              your TV, phone, radio, MP3. When reading online, close all
              other windows, set Skype to offline, turn off chats, and
              release yourself from Facebook etc. Philosophical texts
              reward focused, careful, and repeated reading. Besides,
              you can expect me to call on you with questions about it.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One strategy for
              reading that has proven helpful is this: Before class,
              read through the assignment carefully at least once,
              trying to make as much sense of it as you can. Then come
              to class and take good notes and participate (see below).
              Then, after class, read the assignment again. You should
              find it more comprehensible then. (If you don&#8217;t, come see
              me right away.)<br>
              <br>

              responses to the current reading questions with you.<br>

              copying what&#8217;s on the board or screen (or whatever I'm
              doing in class) may not be enough. If the notes you take
              during class are sketchy, take a moment after class to
              fill them out.<br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Participate a lot. </span>Some






































































              students assume their questions aren't worth asking or
              their comments not worth making, but often others wanted
              to say the same thing. Don&#8217;t allow yourself to stay
              confused or lost. If you are not comfortable speaking in
              class, see me outside it.<br>

              <span style="font-weight: bold;">If you miss class, </span>make






































































              arrangements with others to share notes with you. I
              suggest agreeing with at least two other people in the
              class, at the beginning of the semester, to share notes.
              If class is taught remotely, watch the recordings. <br>

              classmates (if you like--studying in groups is helpful)
              and write out the clearest, most complete and thoughtful
              answers you can. Study your answers regularly to prepare
              for class discussion and for exams. This will pay off.<br>
