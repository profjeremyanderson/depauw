<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">For some time the
appellant had been J&#8217;s mistress but their relationship ceased in
consequence of the appellant suffering from some gynaecological
trouble. Thereafter the appellant became suspicious of J&#8217;s relationship
with a Mrs. B; she made attempts to break up that relationship by
writing anonymous letters. Eventually one night she drove to the house
where Mrs. B was living with her son and two daughters, and set fire to
it. She did nothing to alert the occupants of the house to the danger
she had put them in, or the fire brigade, but drove back to her home
some five miles away. As a result of the fire Mrs. B&#8217;s two daughters
were killed. The appellant was charged with their murder. She admitted
that she realised that what she had done was very dangerous to anyone
living in the house but said that she did not intend to cause death or
grievous bodily harm; she was jealous of Mrs. B, whom she believed to
be about to marry J, and her motive in starting the fire was to
frighten Mrs. B into leaving the neighbourhood. The judge directed the
jury that the prosecution prove beyond reasonable doubt that the
appellant intended to kill or do serious bodily harm to Mrs. B. They
were told that, if they were satisfied that &#8216;when the [appellant] set
fire to the house she knew that it was highly probable that this to
would cause... serious bodily harm&#8217;, then the prosecution had
established the necessary intent and it was immaterial that the
appellant&#8217;s motive was merely to frighten Mrs. B. The appellant was
convicted of murder and her appeal to the Court of Appeal<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>1</sup></font> was dismissed. She appealed to the
House of Lords, contending (i) that the knowledge that a certain
consequence was a highly probable consequence did not establish an
intent to produce that result, and (ii) that in order to sustain a
convicted for murder it was necessary to prove an intent to kill or to
endanger life and therefore intent to do serious bodily harm did not
suffice.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><b>Held</b> (Lord
Diplock and Lord Kilbrandon dissenting) - The appeal would be dismissed
for the following reasons - </p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">(i) (Lord Diplock
and Lord Kilbrandon concurring). In order in establish the mens rea of
murder it was sufficient to prove that, when the accused performed the
relevant acts, he knew that it was probable that those acts would in
grievous bodily harm to somebody, even though he did not desire to
bring that result about. However (per Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone)
it was necessary to show that the accused intended to expose a
potential victim to the risk of grievous bodily harm in that the
accused&#8217;s acts had been performed deliberately and without lawful
excuse (see p. 52 <i>a</i> to <i>c e</i> and <i>h</i> to p. 53 <i>a,</i>
p. 54 <i>g </i>and <i>j</i> to p. 55 <i>e</i>, p. 56 <i>d</i> to <i>f,</i>
p. 59 <i>d</i> to <i>f, </i>p. 61 <i>a</i> to <i>d,</i> p. 62 <i>d</i>
and <i>e</i>, p. 63 <i>a</i> to <i>c,</i> p. 71 <i>b</i> to <i>f</i>
and p.72 <i>c</i> to <i>f</i>, post).</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">(ii) For that
purpose &#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217; meant &#8216;really serious bodily harm&#8217; and
was not limited to harm of such a nature as to endanger life (see p. 47
<i>b</i> to <i>d</i>, p. 56 <i>d,</i> p 61 <i>f </i>and <i>h</i>
to p. 62 <i>a</i> and <i>d </i>and p. 71 <i>d</i> and <i>f, </i>post).</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">(iii) It followed
that the appellant was guilty of murder for, on the direction given to
them by the judge, the jury must have been satisfied that, when the
appellant set fire to the house, she realised that it was highly
probable that one or more of the inmates would suffer serious bodily
harm in consequence of her acts but nevertheless she had deliberately
chosen to expose them to that danger (see p. 56 <i>b</i> and <i>c,</i>
p. 57 <i>e</i>, p. 59 <i>g</i> and p. 71 <i>g,</i> post),</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><b>Per Lord Diplock</b>.
In murder and crimes of that class no distinction is to be drawn
between the state of mind of one who does an act because he desires it
to produce a particular evil consequence, and the state of mind of one
who does an act knowing that it is likely to produce that consequence,
although it may not be the object he was seeking to achieve by doing
the act. What is common to both those states of mind is willingness to
produce the particular evil consequence and that is the mens rea needed
to satisfy a requirement that in order to constitute the offence with
which the accused is charged he must have acted with &#8216;intent&#8217; to
produce a particular evil consequence (see p. 63 <i>a</i> to <i>c</i>.
post).</p>

<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><b>Appeal</b></p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">On 24th November
1972 in the Crown Court at Warwick before Ackner J. the appellant,
Pearl Kathleen Hyam, was convicted (by a majority verdict of 11 to 1)
on two counts charging her with murder. She was sentenced to life
imprisonment. She appealed against conviction by leave of the trial
judge. On 18th June 1973 the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>2</sup></font> (Cairns LJ, Browne and Shaw JJ)
dismissed the appeal but certified that the decision involved a point
of law of general public importance and gave leave to appeal to the
House of Lords. The facts are set out in the opinion of Lord Hailsham
of St Marylebone.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><i>Charles
McCullough QC</i> and <i>B A Farrer</i> for the appellant.<br>
<i>Sir M Havers QC</i>, <i>LS Shields QC</i> and <i>Bruce Laughland</i>
for the Crown.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Their Lordships
took time for consideration.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">21st March. The
following opinions were delivered.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><b><a
 name="hailsham"></a>LORD HAILSHAM OF ST.MARYLEBONE</b>. My Lords, in
my view the one point in this case is the intention which is necessary
to impute to an accused person in order to find him guilty of the crime
of murder. Is it simply the intention to kill or cause grievous bodily
harm (in the sense of really serious injury) as is commonly assumed, or
is it enough that he intends wilfully to expose another to the risk of
death or grievous bodily harm in the sense of really serious injury? I
do not believe that knowledge or any degree of foresight is enough.
Knowledge or foresight is at the best material which entitles or
compels a jury to draw the necessary inference as to intention. But
what is that intention? It is acknowledged that intention to achieve
the result of death or grievous bodily harm in the sense of really
serious injury is enough to convict. But may the intention wilfully to
expose a victim to the serious risk of death or really serious injury
also be enough? It is on the answer to this question that, in my view,
depends the outcome of the present appeal.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">On an indictment
containing two counts alleging the murder of two female children the
appellant in this case pleaded guilty to manslaughter, but after a
trial lasting three days was convicted of murder by a majority verdict
of 11 to one. The question in the appeal is whether the verdicts of
murder can stand or whether verdicts of manslaughter should be
substituted for them.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The facts are
simple, and not in dispute. In the early hours of Saturday, 15<sup>th</sup>
July 1972, the appellant set fire to a dwelling-house in Coventry by
deliberately pouring about a half gallon of petrol through the
letterbox and igniting it by means of a news - paper and a match. The
house contained four persons, presumably asleep. They were a Mrs. Booth
and her three children, a boy and the two young girls who were the
subjects of the charges. Mrs. Booth and the boy escaped alive through a
window. The two girls died as the result of asphyxia by the fumes
generated by the fire. The appellant&#8217;s motive (in the sense in which I
shall use the word &#8216;motive&#8217;) was jealously of Mrs. Booth whom the
appellant believed was likely to marry a Mr. Jones of whom the
appellant herself was the discarded, or partly discarded, mistress. Her
account of her actions, and her defence, was that she had started the
fire only with the intention of frightening Mrs. Booth into leaving the
neighbourhood, and that she did not intend to cause death or grievous
bodily harm. The judge directed the jury:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;The prosecution must prove, beyond all reasonable doubt, that the
accused intended to (kill or) do serious bodily harm to Booth, the
mother of the deceased girls. If you are satisfied that when the
accused set fire to the house she knew that it was highly probable that
this would cause (death or) serious bodily harm then the prosecution
will have established the necessary intent. It matters not if her
motive was, as she says, to frighten Mrs. Booth.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The judge
explained that he had put brackets round the words &#8216;kill or&#8217; and &#8216;death
or&#8217; because he advised the jury to concentrate on the intent to do
serious bodily harm rather than the intent to kill.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">There were other
passages in the summing-up to the same effect, but this was the vital
passage, and the judge reduced it to writing and caused the jury to
retire with it into the jury room. As the case proceeded, it is the
only passage in the judge&#8217;s summing-up to which I need draw attention,
and gives rise to the only point which was argued before your
Lordships&#8217; House. The Court of Appeal <font color="#ff0000"><sup>3</sup></font>
dismissed the appeal &#8216;not without some reluctance&#8217;, and, in giving
leave to appeal to the House of Lords, certified that it involved the
following point of law of general public importance, namely, the
question:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;Is malice aforethought in the crime of murder established by
proof beyond reasonable doubt that when doing the act which led to the
death of another the accused knew that it was highly probable that that
act would result in death or serious bodily harm?&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">This is the only
question which, in my view, it is necessary to consider and the whole
appeal is, therefore, within a fairly narrow compass. Both in the Court
of Appeal and in your Lordships&#8217; House the Crown disclaimed, in my view
rightly; any argument based on the so called &#8216;proviso&#8217; (now s 2(1) of
the Criminal Appeal Act 1968), and accordingly the question certified
remains to be considered solely on its merits.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Before directing
my mind to the simple point involved there are two general topics I
desire to discuss. The first is as to the historical context in which
the point falls to be decided, and the second is as to the precise
senses in which I shall endeavour to use certain common words such as
&#8216;motive&#8217;, &#8216;intention&#8217;, &#8216;purpose&#8217;, &#8216;object&#8217;, &#8216;desire&#8217;.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">My Lords, the
distinction between murder and manslaughter, both felonies at common
law, appears to derive from the statutes of Henry VIII<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>4</sup></font> and Edward VI<font color="#ff0000"><sup>5</sup></font>
by which benefit of clergy was withdrawn from murder committed ex
malitia praecogitata, which in the form &#8216;malice prepense&#8217; or
&#8216;prepensed&#8217; and &#8216;malice aforethought&#8217; has continued in common use in
legal circles to the present date. (See on this topic Bacon's
Abridgement, sv Murder.)</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The precise value
of this phrase is open to doubt. As long ago as 1883 Stephen<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>6</sup></font> described it as &#8216;a phrase which is
never used except to mislead or to be explained away&#8217; and advised its
abolition as a term of art and the substitution for it of a &#8216;definite
enumeration of the states of mind intended to be taken as constituent
elements of murder.&#8217; In the present case Cairns LJ<font color="#ff0000"><sup>7</sup></font>
in delivering the judgment now appealed from said:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;There is no doubt that murder is killing with "malice
aforethought", and there is no doubt that neither the word "malice" nor
the word "aforethought" is to be construed in any ordinary sense.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">I agree with this
latter observation, and would myself think that the sooner the phrase
is consigned to the limbo of legal history the better for precision and
lucidity in the interpretation of our criminal law.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">However, &#8216;malice
aforethought&#8217; was and is part of our criminal jurisprudence and by the
beginning of the 20th century (and for long before that) had come by
judicial interpretation to cover a number of states of mind which
rendered guilty of murder men and women whose conviction of a capital
offence would not be considered acceptable today even by the most
convinced adherents of the death penalty. In the first place, until the
decision in <i>Woolmington v Director of Public Prosecutions</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>8 </sup></font>it was commonly held<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>9</sup></font>: </p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;Every person who kills another is presumed to have wilfully
murdered him, unless the circumstances are such as to raise a contrary
presumption. </p>
  <p>The burden of proving circumstances of excuse, justification, or
extenuation is upon the person who is shown to have killed another.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">In the second
place, by a doctrine known as that of &#8216;constructive malice&#8217; a person
was deemed to have committed murder ex malitia praecogitata if he had
either of the following states of mind:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;An intent to commit any felony whatever;</p>
  <p>&#8216;An intent to oppose by force any officer of justice on his way
to, in, or returning from the execution of the duty of arresting,
keeping in custody, or imprisoning, any person whom he is lawfully
entitled to arrest, keep in custody, or imprison, or the duty of
keeping the peace or dispersing an unlawful assembly, provided that the
offender has notice that the person killed is such an officer so
employed&#8217;,</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">and the expression
&#8216;officer of justice&#8217; could be held to include not merely a constable,
but any private person who happened in the given circumstances to have
the right to do any of the acts concerned<font color="#ff0000"><sup>10</sup></font>.
This remained the law until 1957, when, by s 1 of the Homicide Act of
that year, the doctrine of constructive malice in the above sense was
abolished and a man was said not to be guilty of murder unless the
killing were-</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;done with the same malice aforethought (express or implied) as is
required for a killing to amount to murder when not done in the course
or furtherance of another offence.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Incidentally, in
my view this section dearly recognises a state of affairs described as
&#8216;implied malice&#8217; which is distinguished both from &#8216;express malice&#8217; and
from &#8216;constructive malice&#8217;. This may be an inconvenient terminology but
no account of the law which fails to recognise it can be considered
accurate </p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Further, the same
Act of Parliament also reduced the number of cases of murder ex malitia
praecogitata by inaugurating the defence of &#8216;diminished responsibility&#8217;
(Homicide Act 1957, s 2). In approaching the question which I am asked
to decide today, insofar as I am a free agent, I cannot ignore the
repeatedly evinced intention of Parliament (soon afterwards, as I shall
proceed to show, added to by s 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967) to
mitigate the severity of the law as it developed under the successive
interpretations of malice aforethought by judicial decision.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The abolition of
the doctrine of constructive malice laid the way open for the decision
in <i>R v Vickers</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>11</sup></font>
reargued before a particularly strong full Court of Criminal Appeal.
Technically this decision only rejected the ingenious argument of some
academic lawyers that, by enacting s 1 of the Homicide Act 1957,
Parliament, despite the express words of the section, had inadvertently
got rid of the doctrine of implied malice as well as constructive
malice. But, in giving the judgment of the court, Lord Goddard CJ took
the opportunity to define the doctrine of implied malice so retained,
and to give what has since become the classical definition of murder,
repeatedly employed ever since, as killing &#8216;with the intention [either]
to kill or to do some grievous bodily harm&#8217; (see per Lord Goddard CJ<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>12</sup></font>, quoting from the summing-up of
the trial judge). It will be noticed that in this definition the
reference is to intention and there is no reference to foresight of the
consequences as such either as equivalent to intention in murder or as
an alternative to the requisite intention, or to a &#8216;high degree of
probability&#8217; to describe the degree of certainty of what has to be
foreseen, although both the foresight and the degree of probability
must be at least material which the jury may and, on occasion, must use
as the basis on which an adverse inference is drawn as to the intention
of the killer. Not unnaturally counsel for the appellant in this case
strongly stressed this circumstance in his argument before their
Lordships. I have to remark that if at this stage we were to overthrow
the decision in <i>R</i> <i>v Vickers</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>11</sup></font>
a very high proportion of those now in prison for convictions of murder
must necessarily have their convictions set aside and verdicts of
manslaughter substituted. This consideration ought not perhaps
logically to affect our decision, but I am personally relieved to find
that I find myself in agreement with the decision in <i>R v. Vickers</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>11</sup></font></p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">I now pause to say
a word about the expression &#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217;, another term of art
in English criminal law of respectable pedigree (cf statute 43 Geo 3 c
58 and <i>R v Cox</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>13</sup></font>) but
uncertain meaning. In the context of murder, the Commissioners on the
Criminal Law in their report of 1839<font color="#ff0000"><sup>14</sup></font>
used the expression &#8216;great harm&#8217; as opposed to &#8216;slight harm&#8217; in
connection with murder, but, apart from the context of murder,
&#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217; has been used in connection with various
statutory offences under various Acts including the Offences against
the Person Act 1861 and other statutes and, shortly before that Act,
Willes J in <i>R v Ashman</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>15</sup></font>defined
&#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217; as not necessarily involving injury which is
&#8216;permanent or dangerous, if it be such as seriously to interfere with
comfort or health&#8217;, and for many years Willes J&#8217;s opinion was cited as
the authoritative definition. But this led Lord Devlin<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>16</sup></font> in a moment of extra-judicial
levity to conclude that, if this were right, it would open the door in
murder to a verdict of &#8216;murder by pin prick&#8217;, since it could not be
denied that constantly pricking a man on the stomach with a pin would
certainly seriously interfere with his comfort, and in certain cases by
some misadventure might cause death. In <i>Director of Public
Prosecutions v Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>17</sup></font> to
which I will rum in a moment, the late Viscount Kilmuir LC put an end
to the strange doctrine with the words: </p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;&#8230;I can find no warrant for giving the words "grievous bodily
harm" a meaning other than that which the words convey in their
ordinary and natural meaning. "Bodily harm" needs no explanation and
"grievous" means no more and no less than "really serious".&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Since that date,
if not before, it has been the practice to direct juries on the
authority of <i>R v Vickers</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>11</sup></font>
and this passage in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>17</sup></font>that murder means that a man
causes the death of another &#8216;with the intent to cause death or really
serious injury&#8217;. What injuries are &#8216;really serious&#8217; within the meaning
of this definition is a question left for the jury to decide for
themselves. Obviously it would include any injury likely to endanger
life but, speaking for myself, I would also consider it obvious that
there are many injuries which a jury would call really serious which in
the ordinary course would not be likely to endanger life. I think It
would be difficult by a purely judicial interpretation to restrict the
definition further. In particular, if it were desired to restrict the
definition of murder by defining it as killing with intent to cause
death or endanger life, I would think that an Act of Parliament would
be necessary, and, before passing legislation it would be desirable for
Parliament to investigate policy considerations more widely than is
desirable or possible in the course of a judicial investigation based
on a single case. In particular I would hope that Parliament would
consider whether the substitution in effect of the phrase &#8216;intent to
endanger life&#8217; for &#8216;to inflict really serious injury&#8217; as the mental
element of intention in murder would not impose on juries a task
unnecessarily onerous or would be morally justifiable. One can
visualise a situation in which a defendant said, &#8216;True I intended to
inflict really serious injury on my victim, but it is most unfortunate
that he died. I did not really intend to endanger his life&#8217;. I am not
as dear myself as some of my colleagues that this defence should be
permitted to avail him as a valid defence to a charge of murder.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The next stage in
my historical summary must necessarily be the much discussed case of <i>Director
of Public</i> <i>Prosecutions v Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>17</sup></font>to
which I have just referred in a limited context. One of the questions
much canvassed in the hearing of this appeal was how much if anything
in this decision has survived the enactment of s.8 of the Criminal
Justice Act 1967 and whether, on the assumption that anything relevant
to this appeal survived, this House should yield to the invitation
expressed in the current edition of Smith and Hogan<font color="#ff0000"><sup>18</sup></font>
to &#8216;overrule that case by virtue of the House&#8217;s newly assumed power to
reverse its previous decisions&#8217;.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">I will not
rehearse the facts in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>19</sup></font>since they are sufficiently well
known. A criminal seeking to escape killed a police officer who tried
to stop him by sitting on the bonnet of his car. The criminal
accelerated and threw the officer off in the path of oncoming traffic
and this caused him fatal injuries. The defendant&#8217;s own account of the
matter in court was that he lacked the necessary criminal intention
because he had become frightened. There was a good deal of very
powerful evidence that this defence was untrue in fact, but the judge
in effect directed the jury, which convicted him, that this was not
material, because they should convict of (capital) murder if satisfied
that the accused &#8216;as a reasonable man must have contemplated that
grievous bodily harm to the officer was likely to result as the
consequence of what he did &#8217;. Here there is a clear indication of
foresight of the consequences as a possible ingredient of malice
aforethought, and that likelihood and not certainty of the consequences
is enough. A strong Court of Criminal Appeal<font color="#ff0000"><sup>20</sup></font>
(Byrne, Winn and Sachs JJ) quashed the conviction on the ground that
this was a misdirection. J, in delivering a judgment of the court which
personally I find in the main persuasive, lucid, and coherent, said<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>21</sup></font>:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;The law on this point as it stands today is ... that, as a man is
usually able to foresee what are the natural consequences of his acts,
so it is, as a rule, reasonable to infer that he did foresee them and
intend them. Although, however, that is an inference which may be
drawn. and on the facts in certain circumstances must inevitably be
drawn, yet if on all the facts of the particular case it is not the
correct inference, then it should not be drawn.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">And later<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>22</sup></font>:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;The final question for the jury must always be whether on the
facts as a whole an actual intent to do grievous bodily harm was
established , remembering of course that intent and desire are
different things and that, once it is proved that an accused man knows
that a result is certain, the fact that he does not desire that result
is irrelevant.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The House of Lords<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>20</sup></font>, consisting of Viscount Kilmuir
LC and Lords Goddard, Tucker, Denning, and Parker of Waddington,
reversed the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>20</sup></font>, and it is the opinion of
Viscount Kilmuir LC, speaking with the agreement of the rest, that we
have read in extenso and discussed in considerable detail.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">My Lords, I do not
wish to say anything which is nor deeply respectful of my learned and
greatly admired predecessor as Lord Chancellor with whom I was for many
years on terms of intimate friendship, nor of the extremely strong
House which followed the lead of his speech in this case. But it would
be affectation in me not to recognise that the decision of this House
in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>23</sup></font>
has proved at all times highly controversial, has given rise to an
extensive body of literature both here and in the Commonwealth, and has
proved unusually difficult to interpret (see, for instance, Smith and
Hogan,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>24</sup></font> Glanville Williams
Criminal Law<font color="#ff0000"><sup>25</sup></font>). It was
unequivocally dissented from by the Australian High Court (<i>Parker v R</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>26</sup></font>). It was exhaustively criticised
by the Law Commission (1967), and the Law Commission&#8217;s criticisms
formed the basis, in part, of the action of Parliament in passing the
Criminal Justice Act 1967, s 8, which was believed at the time to have
reversed it (see Smith and Hogan<font color="#ff0000"><sup>25</sup></font>),
and the learned authors of that work, whilst not accepting that this is
the true effect of the section, reach the conclusion that,<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>27</sup></font> &#8216;It would have been most
unfortunate if <i>Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>23</sup></font>
had been held still to be law after all&#8217; and owing to the
interpretation they themselves put on the case they invited this House
to make use of the Practice Direction of 1966<font color="#ff0000"><sup>28</sup></font>
to overrule it as &#8216;the only right course&#8217;. These are weighty criticism
by responsible persons and, in spite of the distinction of the House,
and the reverence and affection with which I regard the memory of my
predecessor, I feel bound to examine them seriously. Indeed, in a
provocative article amongst those cited above one author has done
extensive research which appears to conclude that, in actual practice,
judges, in directing juries, are in fact ignoring, the House of Lords
and following <i>R v Vickers</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>29</sup></font>
and Byrne J in <i>R v Smith</i> (see The Retreat from Smith<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>30</sup></font>).</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">However this may
be, it is beyond question that the actual decision in <i>Director of
Public Prosecutions</i> <i>v Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>31</sup></font>
has given rise to a series of wholly irreconcilable interpretations.
There have been maximalising interpretations, notably from its critics,
and minimalising interpretations, usually from its defenders, e.g. per
Lord Denning MR. and Pearson LJ in <i>Hardy v Motor Insurer's Bureau</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>32</sup></font>. It has been interpreted as
importing an irrebuttable presumption of evidence (Law Commission
Report 1967), and as deciding a new rule of substantive criminal law
Glanville Williams<font color="#ff0000"><sup>33</sup></font> and Smith
and Hogan<font color="#ff0000"><sup>34</sup></font>). It has been
interpreted as being of general application, or limited to the crime of
murder, or to &#8216;such a case as the present&#8217; (per Lord Denning MR. and
Pearson LJ)<font color="#ff0000"><sup>35</sup></font>. It has been
interpreted as importing an objective criterion into the essentially
subjective question of intent, as re-introducing the repealed doctrine
of constructive malice<font color="#ff0000"><sup>36</sup></font> or,
alternatively, as upholding the subjective test of intention, but
sticking an objective label on the nature and quality of the act done.
I am not going to endeavour to decide between these rival and wholly
irreconcilable interpretations for the very good reason that I believe
that each can be justified by particular phrases to be found in the
report. What is beyond question is that an attempt to revive the
decision in toto without interpreting it de novo would be to introduce
confusion and not lucidity into the law. Far better to recognise that
Parliament in 1967, after considering a report by the Law Commission<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>37 </sup></font>, decided that it was better to
turn its back on what was rightly or wrongly taken as the main
argumentation of <i>Director of Public</i> <i>Prosecutions v Smith</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>31</sup></font>, and to impose the rule of a
subjective test both as to foresight of the consequences and as to
intention, as s 8 of the Criminal justice Act 1967 appears to do, while
yet retaining the intention to cause grievous bodily harm (in the sense
explained) as a possible alternative to intent to kill as the essential
mental element in the crime of murder. Such at least is the proper
inference to be drawn from the decision of Parliament to enact the
first and the failure of Parliament to enact the second of the two
draft clauses in the Law Commission's recommendations<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>38</sup></font>, and such at least appears to
have been the view of the Court of Appeal in <i>R v Wallett</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>39</sup></font> which is the last of the
citations I wish to make in this historical survey of the subject.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">In that case a
male defendant of less than average intelligence shook a little girl so
savagely that she died. The trial judge directed the jury impeccably if
the above view of the effect of the Criminal justice Act 1967, s 8, be
accepted, but, when they returned for further guidance as to the
difference between murder and manslaughter, concluded his additional
advice by saying that what the jury had to consider was whether the
defendant knew &#8216;quite well at the time he was doing something <i>any
ordinary person</i> <i>like himself</i> [emphasis mine] would know it
was doing her really serious bodily harm&#8217;. The Court of Appeal<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>40</sup></font> held that it would not be safe to
allow the resulting verdict of guilty to stand. I do not believe that
they could have done so if they had not accepted the general approach
which I have as me true view of the effect of s 8 of the Criminal
justice Act 1967 on <i>Director of Public Prosecution v Smith</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>32</sup></font><i>.</i></p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The judgment of
Winn LJ in <i>R v Wallett</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>40</sup></font>,
was referred to in the Court of Appeal in the present case<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>41</sup></font> as supporting their own view of
the 1967 Act. With respect this carries exactly the opposite
implication to that attached to it by the Court of Appeal. Winn LJ was
saying that so long as the judge was telling the jury that if they were
sure that the accused with all his defects did intend grievous bodily
harm, that is murder, but that the moment he suggested or might be
taken as suggesting that the test was objective his charge fell on the
wrong side of the line laid down by the 1967 Act.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">At the end of the
day there are, I think, two reasons against formally overruling <i>Director
of Public</i> <i>Prosecutions v Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>32</sup></font>
in virtue of our Practice Direction <font color="#ff0000"><sup>42</sup></font>
as suggested by the authors of Smith and Hogan. The first is that in
view of the diversity of interpretation it is difficult to know exactly
what one is overruling. Indeed if the extreme minimalising
interpretations be adopted, there is little or nothing to overrule or
indeed little enough to require the intervention of Parliament in 1967.
The second is that there are at least two passages in <i>Director of
Public Prosecutions v Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>43</sup></font>
of permanent value which on any view ought not to be overruled The
first is the passage at the end of Viscount Kilmuir LC&#8217;s opinion<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>44</sup></font> which disposes at least in this
context of the doctrine of <i>R v Ashman</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>45</sup></font>
regarding the nature of grievous bodily harm, and thus excludes the
possibility of &#8216;murder by pinprick&#8217;. The second is the earlier passage<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>46</sup></font> where Viscount Kilmuir LC says:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;The unlawful and voluntary act must dearly be aimed at someone in
order to eliminate cases of negligence or of careless or dangerous
driving.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">There is also a
more important third element latent in the decision to which I will
return later, and which seems to justify the result, if not all the
reasoning.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The view taken
above of <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>43</sup></font> and of the 1967 Act is not enough
to dispose of the present appeal. For, whatever may be said by way of
criticism of the crucial passage in the judge&#8217;s direction, it was
impeccable at least in this, that it applied the jury&#8217;s mind to a
subjective test of what was the state of the mind of the accused. The
question raised by Ackner J&#8217;s charge to the jury is not whether he
revived the passages in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>43</sup></font> which seem to suggest an
objective test, but (i) whether, on the assumption that the test is
subjective, foresight of the probable consequences is an alternative
species of malice aforethought to intention, or, as Pearson LJ dearly
suggests in <i>Hardy v</i> <i>Motor Insurers&#8217; Bureau</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>47</sup></font>, whether foresight of the
probable consequence is only another way of describing intention and
(ii) on the assumption that foresight can be used as an alternative or
equivalent of intention whether a high degree of probability in that
which is foreseen is enough. This seems to me the point in this case,
and I do not find it altogether easy to decide In order to equip myself
to do so, I must embark on a brief enquiry into the meaning of some
ordinary words It has been pointed out more than once that &#8216;motive&#8217; has
two distinct but related meanings I do not claim to say which sense is
correct. Both are used but it is important to realise that they are not
the same. In the first sense &#8216;motive&#8217; means an emotion prompting an
act. This is the sense in which I used the term when I said that the
admitted motive of the appellant was jealousy of Mrs. Booth. The motive
for murder in this sense may be jealousy, fear, hatred, desire for
money, perverted lust, or even, as in so called &#8216;mercy killings&#8217;,
compassion or love. In this sense motive is entirely distinct from
intention or purpose. It is the emotion which gives rise to the
intention and it is the latter and not the former which converts an
actus reus into a criminal act. Thus as Smith and Hogan point out<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>48</sup></font>, &#8216;The mother who kills her
imbecile and suffering child ...is just as guilty of murder as the man
who kills for gain.&#8217; (See also the discussion on this used by Viscount
Maugham<font color="#ff0000"><sup>49</sup></font>). On the other hand
&#8216;motive&#8217; can mean a &#8216;kind of intention&#8217; (see Glanville Williams<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>50</sup></font>). In this sense, in his direction
to the jury, the judge (quoted above, and in the judgment of the Court
of Appeal<font color="#ff0000"><sup>51</sup></font>) has said: &#8216;It
matters not if her motive was&#8230; to frighten Mrs. Booth.&#8217; See also the
discussion of this sense by Lord Wright<font color="#ff0000"><sup>52</sup></font>.
I agree with the Court of Appeal that it is desirable, to avoid
confusion, to use the word &#8216;motive&#8217; in this context always in the first
sense, and I have attempted so to do.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">It is, however,
important to realise that in the second sense too, motive, which in
that sense is to be equated with the ultimate &#8216;end&#8217; of a course of
action, often described as its &#8216;purpose&#8217; or &#8216;object&#8217;, although &#8216;a kind
of intention&#8217;, is not co-extensive with intention, which embraces, in
addition to the end, all the necessary consequences of an action
including the means to the end and any consequences intended along with
the end. In the present case the appellant&#8217;s &#8216;motive&#8217; - in the second
sense - may have been to frighten Mrs. Booth. This does not exclude,
and the jury must have affirmed, the intention to expose the sleepers
in the house to the high probability of grievous bodily harm and in
many cases it may involve an actual intention to kill or cause grievous
bodily harm. Thus, also, in a Victorian melodrama the villain&#8217;s motive
- in the second sense-or his &#8216;end&#8217;, his &#8216;purpose&#8217;, &#8216;object&#8217; or
&#8216;intention&#8217; may have been to acquire an inheritance But this does not
exclude, and may involve, the intention to slay the rightful heir, or
abduct his sister. Or again, in the Law Commission&#8217;s report<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>53</sup></font> on <i>Director of Public
Prosecutions v Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>54</sup></font> the
example is given where the end is to be paid insurance moneys, the
means is to blow up an aircraft in flight, and the inseparable
consequence is the death of passengers and crew.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">I know of no
better judicial interpretation of &#8216;intention&#8217; or &#8216;intent&#8217; than that
given in a civil case by Asquith LJ (<i>Cunliffe v Goodman</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>55</sup></font>) when he said:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;An "intention, " to my mind, connotes a state of affairs which
the parry "intending" - I will call him X.-does more than merely
contemplate. It connotes a state of affairs which, on the contrary, he
decides, so far as in him lies, to bring about, and which, in point of
possibility, he has a reasonable prospect of being able to bring about,
by his own act of volition.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">If this be a good
definition of &#8216;intention&#8217; for the purposes of the criminal law of
murder, and so long as it is held to include the means as well as the
end and the inseparable consequences of the end as well as the means, I
think it is dear that &#8216;intention&#8217; is clearly to be distinguished alike
from &#8216;desire&#8217; and from foresight of the probable consequences. As the
Law Commission pointed out in their disquisition<font color="#ff0000"><sup>56</sup></font>
on <i>Director of</i> <i>Public Prosecutions v Smith</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>54</sup></font>, a man may desire to blow up an
air craft in flight in order to obtain insurance moneys. But if any
passengers are killed he is guilty of murder, as their death will be a
moral certainty if he carries our his intention. There is no difference
between blowing up the aircraft and intending the death of some or all
of the passengers. On the other hand, the surgeon in a heart transplant
operation may intend to save his patient&#8217;s life, but he may recognise
that there is at least a high degree of probability that his action
will kill the patient. In that case he intends his patient&#8217;s life, but
he foresees as a high degree of probability that he will cause his
death, which he neither intends nor desires, since he regards the
operation not as a means to killing his patient, but as the best, and
possibly the only, means of ensuring his survival.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">If this be the
right view of the meaning of words, the question certified in this case
must, strictly speaking, be answered in the negative. No doubt
foresight and the degree of likelihood with which the consequences are
foreseen are essential factors which should be placed before a jury in
directing them whether the consequences are intended. But the true view
is that put forward by Byrne J in <i>Director of</i> <i>Public
Prosecutions v Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>54</sup></font>:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;While that is an inference which may be drawn, and on the facts
in certain circumstances must inevitably be drawn, yet if on all the
facts of the particular case it is not the correct inference, then it
should not be drawn.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">This is in
accordance with the views of Denning LJ in <i>Hosegood v Hosegood</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>57</sup></font> when he says:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;When people say that a man must be taken to intend the natural
consequences of his acts, they fall into error: there is no "must"
about it. It is only "may".&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">This passage was
cited by Lord Porter in <i>Lang v Lang</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>58</sup></font><i>,
</i>where the perfectly proper distinction, noted above, that a
consequence may be intended though it is not desired, is also drawn,
and should be taken as established.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">I do not,
therefore, consider, as was suggested in argument, that the fact that a
state of affairs is correctly foreseen as a highly probable consequence
of what is done is the same thing as the fact that the state of affairs
is intended. The highest that can be put in the context of the present
set of facts is that what was intended was to expose the inhabitants of
the house to the serious risk of death or grievous bodily harm and not
actually to cause death or grievous bodily harm I do not think that
these propositions are identical.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">But this, again,
does not dispose of the matter. Another way of putting the case for the
Crown was that, even if it be conceded that foresight of the probable
consequences is not the same thing as intention, it can, nevertheless,
be an alternative type of malice aforethought, equally effective as
intention to convert an unlawful killing into murder. This view, which
is inconsistent with the view that foresight of a high degree of
probability is only another way of describing intention, derives some
support from the way in which the proposition is put in Stephen&#8217;s Digest<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>59</sup></font> where it is said that malice
aforethought for the purpose of the law of murder includes a state of
mind in which there is-</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;Knowledge that the &#8216;act which causes death will probably cause
the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, some person, whether such
person is the person actually killed or not although such&#8217; knowledge is
accompanied by indifference whether death or grievous bodily harm is
caused or not, or by a wish that it may not be caused&#8217;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">If this be right,
Ackner J&#8217;s direction can be justified on the grounds that such
knowledge is itself a separate species of malice aforethought and not
simply another way of describing intention. Apart from <i>Director of</i>
<i>Public Prosecutions v Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>60</sup></font>
( if and insofar as it may be regarded as authority for this
proposition) the diligence of counsel was unable to discover an English
case directly supporting this view, but persuasive authority for it
exists in <i>R v Jakac</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>61</sup></font>
where the Supreme Court of Victoria expressly adopted the passage from
Stephen&#8217;s Digest cited above and said: &#8216;We do not think that the
passage cited from <i>Stephen&#8217;s Digest</i> has ever been seriously
challenged as a correct statement of the law&#8217;. Further support for the
view of the law embodied in this proposition can be derived from the
direction of Avory J. to the jury in <i>R v Lumley</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>62</sup></font> and perhaps from the direction in
<i>R v Ward</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>63</sup></font> described in
the Court of Criminal Appeal in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v
Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>64</sup></font> as the &#8216;high
water-mark&#8217; and not to be relied on now as a fair direction in other </p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">respects in the
light of the Criminal justice Act 1967, s 8. Reference was also made to
the 19th century case of <i>R v Desmond</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>65</sup></font>
in which Cockburn CJ after expounding the doctrine of constructive
malice, which then applied, said:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;There was another and larger view of the case. If a man did an
act, more especially if that were an illegal act, although its
immediate purpose might not be to take life, yet if it were such that
life was necessarily endangered by it, if a man did such an act, not
with the purpose of taking life, but with the knowledge or belief that
life was likely to be sacrificed by it, that was not only murder by the
law of England, but by the law of probably every other country.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">This clearly
applies the test of foresight, and the criterion of probability and not
certainty, but the foresight described is of danger to life, and not
grievous bodily harm even in the sense defined in <i>Director of Public</i>
<i>Prosecutions v Smith</i>.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>64</sup></font>
Like other 19th century cases, the direction given was at a time when
no jury could have the prisoner&#8217;s sworn testimony to consider, and when
there was no adequate system of criminal appeal. Moreover, it is not
really satisfactory to charge a jury two parallel legal theories each
leading to the same result and leave them with no means of saying which
of the two their verdict is intended to follow. The jury itself may
well have founded their verdict in <i>R v Desmond</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>65</sup></font> entirely on the doctrine of
constructive malice to which, at the time, the defence had, it would
seem, no possible answer.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">At this point
counsel on both sides addressed a number of arguments to the House
based on principle and public policy. Of these the most notable were as
follows:</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">(1) Counsel for
the Crown urged the necessity of treating deaths such as any arising
from the recent bomb outrages as murder. Reference was made to the 19th
century case of <i>R v Desmond</i>.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>65</sup></font>
These cases, however, must surely be judged like any other on their
facts. If murder consists, and consists only, in slaying with intent to
kill, or intent to cause grievous harm to some person, a jury must
decide the matter after taking into account all relevant circumstances
including any warnings given, and any evidence tendered on behalf of
the accused, and come to the appropriate conclusion. There should be no
difficulty in securing convictions in appropriate cases. If, on the
other hand, the mental ingredients in murder may consist in the
deliberate exposure of potential victims to the substantial risk of
death or grievous bodily harm, in the actual knowledge that such risk
is being incurred, then an appropriate direction to that effect can be
made. I do not think that it is appropriate for this House in its
judicial capacity to be unduly swayed by motives of public policy in
defining crimes which have been so long before the courts as have
murder and manslaughter.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">(2) Counsel for
the defence argued that actual foresight of a high degree of
probability was too indefinite a phrase to enable juries consistently
to administer this important branch of the law. Reference was made to
an observation of Lord Reid in a recent civil case <i>( Southern
Portland Cement v Cooper</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>66</sup></font>
)with which I respectfully agree. Lord Reid said:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;Chance probability or likelihood is always a matter of degree. It
is rarely capable of precise assessment. Many different expressions are
in common use. It can be said that the occurrence of a future event is
very likely, rather likely, more probable than not, not unlikely, quite
likely, not improbable, more than a mere possibility etc. It is neither
practicable nor reasonable to draw a line at extreme probability.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">If I were to
accept the direction of Ackner J. as correct in the present case for
all purposes, or to answer without qualification the question certified
in the affirmative, I should, I think, be driven to draw the line in a
criminal case of high importance at precisely the point at which it was
said to be neither practicable nor reasonable to do so.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">I am however,
qualify the negative answer I have proposed to the question certified
as of general public importance. For the reasons I have given, I do not
think that foresight as such of a high degree of probability is at all
the same thing as intention, and, in my view, it is not foresight but
intention which constitutes the mental element in murder. It is the
absence of intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm which
absolves the heart surgeon m the case of the transplant,
notwithstanding that he foresees as a matter of high probability that
his action will probably actually kill the patient. It is the presence
of an actual intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm which
convicts the murderer who takes a very long shot at his victim and
kills him notwithstanding that he think correctly as he takes his aim
that the odds are very much against his hitting him at all.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">But what are we to
say of the state of mind of a defendant who knows that a proposed
course of conduct exposes a third party to a serious risk of death or
grievous bodily harm, without actually intending those consequences,
but nevertheless and without lawful excuse deliberately pursues that
course of conduct regardless whether the consequences to his potential
victim take place or not? In that case, if my analysis be correct,
there is not merely actual foresight of the probable consequences, but
actual intention to expose his victim to the risk of those consequences
whether they in fact occur or not. Is that intention sufficient to
reduce the crime to manslaughter notwithstanding a jury's finding that
they are sure that it was the intention with which the act was done? In
my opinion, it is not, and in this my opinion corresponds with the
opinion of the Commissioners on the Criminal Law<font color="#ff0000"><sup>67</sup></font>
when they said, &#8216;Again, it appears to us that it ought to make no
difference in point of legal distinction whether death results from a
direct intention to kill, or from wilfully doing an act of which death
is the probable consequence&#8217;. And again in a later passage<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>68</sup></font> , &#8216;It is the <i>wilful exposure</i>
of life to peril that constitutes the crime&#8217;. The heart surgeon exposes
his patient to the risk, but does everything he can to save his
regarding his actions as the best or only means of securing the
patient&#8217;s survival. He is, therefore, not exposing his patient to the
risk without lawful excuse or regardless of the consequences. The
reckless motorist who is guilty of manslaughter, but not murder, is not
at least ordinarily aiming his actions at anyone in the sense explained
in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>69</sup></font>
If he were, it is quite possible that, as in <i>Director of Public
Prosecutions v Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>70</sup></font> , he
might be convicted of murder. In the field of guilty knowledge it has
long been accepted both for the purposes of criminal and civil law that
&#8216;a man who deliberately shuts his eyes to the truth will not be heard
to say that he did not know it&#8217;. (See per Lord Reid in <i>Southern
Portland Cement v Cooper</i>.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>71</sup></font>
) Cannot the same be said of the state of intention of a man who, with
actual appreciation of the risks, and without lawful excuse, wilfully
decides to expose potential victims to the risk of death or really
serious injury regardless of whether the consequences take place or
not? This seems to me to be the truth underlying the statement of the
law in Stephen&#8217;s Digest, the summing-up of Cockburn CJ in <i>R v
Desmond</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>72</sup></font> , and of Avory J
in <i>R v Lumley</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>73</sup></font> and of
those phrases in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>70</sup></font> in which it seems to be said that
a rational man must be taken to intend the consequences of his acts. It
is not a revival of the doctrine of constructive malice or the
substitution of an objective for a subjective test of knowledge or
intention. It is the man&#8217;s actual state of knowledge and intent which,
as in all other cases, determines his criminal responsibility. Nor, for
the like reason, does this set up an irrebuttable presumption. It
simply prod the moral truth that if a man, in full knowledge of the
danger involved, and without lawful excuse, deliberately does that
which exposes a victim to the risk of the probable grievous bodily harm
(in the sense explained) or death, and the victim dies, the perpetrator
of the crime is guilty of murder and not manslaughter to the same
extent as if he had actually intended the consequence to follow, and
irrespective of whether he wishes it. That is because the two types of
intention are morally indistinguishable, although factually and
logically distinct, and because it is therefore just that they should
bear the same consequences to the perpetrator as they have the same
consequences for the victim if death ensues.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">This is not very
far from the situation in this case. The jury appear to have taken this
as a carefully premeditated case and that this was so can hardly be
disputed, and, though it was disputed, the jury clearly rejected this
view. The appellant had made her way to the house in a van in the early
hours of the morning. She took with her a jerry can containing at least
half a gallon of petrol. As she passed Mr. Jones&#8217;s house she carefully
made sure that he was in his own home and not with Mrs. Booth, because,
as she said, she did not want to do Mr. Jones any harm She parked the
van at a distance from Mrs. Booth&#8217;s house, and when she got to the
front door she carefully removed a milk bottle from the step in case
she might knock it a over and arouse somebody by the noise. And when
she had started the fire she crept back to her van and made off home
without amusing anyone or giving the alarm. Once it is conceded that
she was actually and subjectively aware of the danger to the sleeping
occupants of the house in what she did, and that was the point which
the judge brought to the jury&#8217;s attention, it must surely follow
naturally that she did what she did with the intention of exposing them
to the danger of death or really serious injury regardless of whether
such consequences actually ensued or not. Obviously in theory, a
further logical step is involved after actual foresight of the
probability of danger is established. But in practice and in the
context of this case the step is not one which, given the facts, can be
seriously debated. For this reason I do not think the summing-up can be
faulted, since the judge drew the jury&#8217;s attention to the only
debatable question in the case, and gave them a correct direction in
regard to it.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">I therefore
propose the following propositions in answer to the question of general
public importance.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">(1) Before an act
can be murder it must be &#8216;aimed at someone&#8217; as explained in <i>Director
of Public</i> <i>Prosecutions v Smith</i>,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>70</sup></font>
and must in addition be an act committed with one of the following
intentions, the test of which is always subjective to the actual
defendant: (i) The intention to cause death; (ii) The intention to
cause grievous bodily harm in the sense of that term explained in <i>Director
of Public Prosecutions v</i> <i>Smith</i>,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>74</sup></font>
&nbsp; i.e. really serious injury; (iii) Where the defendant knows that
there is a serious risk that death or grievous bodily harm will ensue
from his acts, and commits those acts deliberately and without lawful
excuse, the intention to expose a potential victim to that risk as the
result of those acts. It does not matter in such circumstances whether
the defendant desires those consequences to ensue or not and in none of
these cases does it matter that the act and the intention were aimed at
a potential victim other than the one who succumbed.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">(2) Without an
intention of one of these three types the mere fact that the
defendant&#8217;s conduct is done in the knowledge that grievous bodily harm
is likely or highly likely to ensue from his conduct is not by itself
enough to convert a homicide into the crime of murder. Nevertheless,
for the reasons I have given in my opinion the appeal fails and should
be dismissed.<br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><b><a
 name="dilhorne"></a>VISCOUNT DILHORNE</b>. My Lords, for some
considerable time the appellant had had regular sexual relations with a
Mr. Jones. In consequence of her having some gynaecological trouble
those relations ceased and were not resumed after she had had an
operation in 1968. She became suspicious of Mr. Jones&#8217;s relations with
a Mrs. Booth and very jealous of her. She tried to break up that
association by the writing of anonymous letters. In May 1972 Mrs. Booth
obtained a decree nisi for divorce from her husband. That decree was
due to be made absolute towards the end of July 1972 and then Mrs.
Booth would have been free to marry Mr. Jones.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">On 15th July 1972
at about 2 a m the appellant drove a van to the house where Mrs. Booth
lived with her son and two daughters aged, we were told, 17 and 11. On
her way there she went past Mr. Jones house to see if he was there. The
lights were on so she decided that he was. She did that, she said,
because she did not want to do any harm to Mr. Jones. She parked the
van round the corner from Mrs. Booth&#8217;s house. She took a gallon can of
petrol from the van and poured petrol through the letterbox in Mrs.
Booth&#8217;s front door. She then put newspaper in the letterbox and lit it.
The petrol ignited and the appellant said that she realised that what
she had done was tremendously dangerous to anyone living in the house.
She, however, did nothing to alert the occupants of the house to the
danger she had put them in or the fire brigade. She just drove to her
home some five miles away. Mrs. Booth and her son succeeded in escaping
from the house. Her two daughters did not and were killed. The
appellant was charged with, and convicted of. their murder.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">At the beginning
of his summing-up Ackner J. told the jury that a person who unlawfully
and deliberately causes the death of another intending either to kill
or to do serious bodily harm is guilty of murder. He said that there
was no dispute that the appellant had killed the two children and that
it was not suggested that the setting fire to the house was other than
a deliberate act. He told the jury that the only question on which they
had to focus their attention was the appellant&#8217;s intent.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">He had written
down, and he had handed to the jury, his direction with regard to
intent. It was in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;The prosecution must prove, beyond all reasonable doubt, that the
accused intended to (kill or) do serious bodily harm to Mrs. Booth, the
mother of the deceased girls. If you are satisfied that when the
accused set fire to the house she knew that it was highly probable that
this would cause (death or) serious bodily harm then the prosecution
will have established the necessary intent. It matters not if her
motive was, as she says, to frighten Mrs. Booth.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">In the light of
that direction and their verdict one must take it that the jury were
satisfied that the appellant knew that, when she set fire to the house,
it was highly probable that she would cause serious bodily harm.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The appellant&#8217;s
appeal to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division)<font color="#ff0000"><sup>75</sup></font>
on the ground that this was a misdirection was dismissed, but that
court granted leave to appeal to this House, certifying that the
following point of law was of general public importance:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;Is malice aforethought in the crime of murder established by
proof beyond reasonable doubt that when doing the act which led to the
death of another the accused knew that it was highly probable that that
act would result in death or serious bodily harm?&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">It is to be
observed that Ackner J. in his direction to the jury said that such
knowledge established the necessary intent. The question certified
asked whether it constituted malice aforethought. If it did, it does
not follow that it established an intent to do grievous bodily harm.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">In this House
counsel for the appellant contended that the question certified should
be answered in the negative. He submitted that knowledge that a certain
consequence was a highly probable consequence does not establish an
intent to produce that result. &#8216;All consequences that are foreseen are
not&#8217;, he said, &#8216;necessarily intended&#8217;.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">He also contended
that the direction given by Ackner J. was erroneous in another respect,
namely, that, despite the decision in <i>R v Vickers</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>76</sup></font> and the decision of this House in
<i>Director of Public Prosecutions v</i> <i>Smith</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>77</sup></font><i> </i>to the contrary, intent
to do grievous bodily harm did not, nor did knowledge that such harm
was the probable result, suffice to make a killing murder. For it to be
murder, he contended that the intent would be to kill or to endanger
life or, if knowledge was enough, knowledge that the act would kill or
endanger life.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">With regard to his
first contention, so long ago as 1868 Cockburn CJ at the Central
Criminal Court in the Fenian trials, <i>R v Desmond</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>78</sup></font> ,directed the jury that if a man
a did an act &#8211; </p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;not with the purpose of taking life, but with the knowledge or
belief that life was likely to be sacrificed by it, that was not only
murder by the law of England, but by the law of probably every other
country.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">In his Digest of
the Criminal Law<font color="#ff0000"><sup>79</sup></font> Sir James
Stephen defined &#8216;malice aforethought&#8217; as involving the following states
of mind:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;<i>(a)</i> An intention to cause the death of, or grievous bodily
harm to, any person, whether such person is the person actually killed
or not;</p>
  <p>&#8216;<i>(b) </i>Knowledge that the act which causes death will
probably cause the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, some other
person, whether such person is the person actually killed or not,
although such knowledge is accompanied indifference whether death or
grievous bodily harm is caused or not, or by a wish that it may not be
caused;</p>
  <p>&#8216;<i>(c)</i> An intent to commit any felony whatever;</p>
  <p>&#8216;<i>(d)</i> An intent to oppose by force any officer of justice on
his way to, in, or returning from the execution of the duty of
arresting, keeping in custody or imprisoning any person whom he is
lawfully entitled to arrest, keep in custody, or imprison, or the duty
of keeping the peace or dispersing an unlawful assembly, provided that
the offender has notice that the person killed is such an officer so
employed.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The Royal
Commission on Capital Punishment<font color="#ff0000"><sup>80</sup></font>
in their report said that this was the statement of the modern law most
commonly cited as authoritative. The Royal Commission did not dissent
from but endorsed Stephen&#8217;s statement that such knowledge amounted to
malice aforethought. In para 76<font color="#ff0000"><sup>81</sup></font>
five proposition were stated which, the report said, were commonly
accepted. The fifth proposition was:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;(v) it is murder if one person kills another by an intentional
act which he knows to be likely to kill or to cause grievous bodily
harm&#8230;and may either be recklessly indifferent as to the results of his
act or may even desire that no harm should be caused by it.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The propositions,
the report said<font color="#ff0000"><sup>82</sup></font> ,fell within
paragraph (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of the article of Stephen&#8217;s Digest
and &#8216;it has been generally agreed that they are properly included in
the category of murder&#8217; and in para 473<font color="#ff0000"><sup>83</sup></font>
it is stated:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;Under the existing law as stated by Stephen, the question the
jury have to consider in such a case is whether the accused knew or was
aware of the likely consequences of his act: and we think that that law
is sound.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">In <i>R v Jakac</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>84</sup></font> the Full Court of the Supreme
Court of Victoria delivered a judgment in which it was said that the
Royal Commission&#8217;s fifth proposition was clearly the law.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Stephen in his
Digest treated such knowledge as a separate head of malice aforethought
and distinct from those in which intent is necessary. The Royal
Commission treated it as justifying a conviction of murder even if the
accused did not intend to kill or to do grievous bodily harm. If this
view is right, then Ackner J. was wrong in telling the jury that proof
of such knowledge established the necessary intent.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">On the other hand,
Lord Devlin in a lecture he gave in 1954<font color="#ff0000"><sup>85</sup></font>
said that where a man has decided that certain consequences would
probably happen, then - </p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;for the purposes of the law he intended them to happen, and it
does not matter whether he wanted them to happen or not... it is
criminal intent in the strict sense.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Pearson LJ appears
to have been of the same opinion for in <i>Hardy v Motor Insurers&#8217;
Bureau</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>86</sup></font> he said:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;Then this is the syllogism. No reasonable man doing such an act
could fail to foresee that it would in all probability injure the other
person. The accused is a reasonable man. Therefore, he must have
foreseen, when he did the act, that it would in all probability injure
the other person. Therefore he had the intent to injure the other
person.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Whether or not it
be that the doing of the act with the knowledge that certain
consequences are highly probable is to be treated as establishing the
intent to bring about those consequences, I think it is clear that for
at least 100 years such knowledge has been recognised as amounting to
malice aforethought. In my opinion it follows if the second contention
advanced on behalf of the appellant that the question certified should
be answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">While I do not
think that it is strictly necessary in this case to decide whether such
knowledge establishes the necessary intent, for if Ackner J. was wrong
about that, it is not such a misdirection as would warrant the quashing
of the conviction as, even if it did not establish intent, it was
correct in that such knowledge amounted to malice aforethought, I am
inclined to the view that Ackner J was correct. A man may do an act
with a number of intentions. If he does it deliberately and
intentionally, knowing when he does it that it is highly probable that
grievous bodily harm will result, I think most people would say and be
justified in saying that whatever other intentions he may have had as
well, he at least intended grievous bodily harm.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">I think, too, that
if Ackner J had left the question of intent in the way in which it is
left in the vast majority of cases, namely, was it proved that the
accused had intended to kill or to do grievous bodily harm, no
reasonable jury could on the facts of this case have come to any other
conclusion than that she had intended to do grievous bodily harm,
bearing in mind her knowledge and the fact that, before she set fire to
the house, she took steps to make sure that Mr. Jones was not in it as
she did not want to harm him. If. the normal direction had been given,
much litigation would have been avoided.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">I now turn to the
second contention advanced an behalf of the appellant. This has two
facets; first, that the reference to the intent to cause grievous
bodily harm has been based on the law that killing in the course or
furtherance of a felony is murder, and that when the Homicide Act 1957
was enacted abolishing constructive malice it meant that it no longer
sufficed to establish intent to do grievous bodily ham; and, secondly,
that, if intent to do grievous bodily harm still made a killing murder,
it must be intent to do grievous bodily harm of such a character that
life was likely to be endangered.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Committing
grievous bodily harm was for many, many years, and until all felonies
were abolished, a felony. Consequently so long as the doctrine of
constructive malice was part of the law of England, to secure a
conviction for murder, it was only necessary to prove that the death
resulted from an act committed in the course of or in furtherance of
the commission of grievous bodily harm. But when one looks at the cases
and the old textbooks, one does not find any indication that proof of
intent to do grievous bodily harm was an ingredient of murder only on
account of the doctrine of constructive malice. Indeed, one finds the
contrary.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Coke in his
Institutes throws no light on this though he went so far as to say<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>87</sup></font> that, if death resulted from an
unlawful act, it was murder. In Hale&#8217;s Pleas of the Crown<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>88</sup></font> it is said that it is murder &#8216;If
a man doe an act that apparently must introduce harm, and death ensue&#8217;,
and in his History of the Pleas of the Crown<font color="#ff0000"><sup>89</sup></font>
it is said that malice which makes a killing murder is of two kinds,
malice in fact and malice in law, and that -</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;Malice in fact is a deliberate intention of doing some corporal
harm to the person of another... It must be a compassing or designing
to do some bodily harm.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Hale<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>90</sup></font> gave as one instance where murder
was to be implied by law the case the killing was done by a person that
intends a theft or burglary. He thus distinguished constructive malice
implied from a killing in the course of or in furtherance of another
offence from malice in fact; and, for there to be malice in fact it was
enough that there should be an intention to do some bodily harm.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Stephen in his
Digest also distinguished between intent to kill or to do grievous
bodily harm and knowledge that death or bodily was likely to result
(paras (<i>a)</i> and (<i>b</i>)) from constructive malice (paras (<i>c</i>)
and (<i>d</i>)), and I can find no case to support the contention that
a direction that an intent to do grievous bodily harm was regarded and
treated as a direction based on constructive malice.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">In <i>R v Bubb, R
v Hook</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>91</sup></font> the jury was
directed that there must be an intention to cause death or some serious
bodily injury. In <i>R v Porter</i>,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>92</sup></font>
Brett J. told the jury that &#8216;if the prisoner kicked the man, intending
to inflict grievous harm and death ensued from it, he was guilty of
murder&#8217;. In <i>R v Doherty</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>93</sup></font>
,Stephens J. said:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;What, then, is the intention necessary to constitute murder?
Several intentions would have this effect; but I need mention only two
in this case, namely, an intention to kill and an intention to do
grievous bodily harm.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">In <i>R v Lumley</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>94</sup></font> Avory J. told a jury that if the
accused had contemplated grievous bodily harm was likely to result, it
was murder. In <i>R.v Gibbins and Procter</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>95</sup></font>
the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed an appeal where the judge had
directed the jury that it would be murder if the accused wilfully and
deliberately withheld food from a child &#8216;so as to cause her to weaken
and to cause her grievous bodily injury as a result of which she died.&#8217;
In <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v Beard</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>96</sup></font>
Lord Birkenhead LC referred to a charge of murder &#8216;based upon intention
to kill or to do grievous bodily harm&#8217; and in <i>Holmes v Director of
Public Prosecutions</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>97</sup></font> Lord
Simon, with whose speech the other Members of the House agreed,
referred to malice as the intention to kill or to inflict grievous
bodily harm.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Killing with
intent to do grievous bodily harm has thus for many years been regarded
as murder, quite apart from the doctrine of constructive malice. This
was recognised in the Report of the Royal Commission on Capital
Punishment.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>98</sup></font> Their five
propositions stated in para 76<font color="#ff0000"><sup>99</sup></font>
which were, so the report said<font color="#ff0000"><sup>100</sup></font>
generally accepted to be properly included in the category of murder,
were - </p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;all cases where the accused either <i>intended</i> to cause
death or grievous bodily harm or <i>knew</i> that his act was likely
to cause death or grievous bodily harm.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The Royal
Commission went on to recommend the abolition of constructive malice,
and in para 123<font color="#ff0000"><sup>101</sup></font> suggested a
clause for inclusion in a Bill to bring that about.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Section 1 of the
Homicide Act 1957 is in all material respects similar to the clause
proposed. It would, indeed, be odd if the Royal Commission by
recommending the abolition of constructive malice had in fact proposed
the abolition of intent to do grievous bodily harm as an ingredient of
murder when the commission had not intended and did not recommend that.
Parliament may, of course do more by an Act than it intends but if, as
in my opinion was the case, intent to do grievous bodily was entirely
distinct from constructive malice, then the conclusion that Parliament
did so by the Homicide Act 1957 must be rejected. In my opinion <i>R v
Vickers</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>102</sup></font> was rightly
decided and this House was right in saving that was so in <i>Director
of Public Prosecutions v Smith.</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>103</sup></font>.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">I now turn to the
second facet of the appellant&#8217;s contention, namely, that the words
&#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217; are to be interpreted as meaning harm of such a
character as is likely to endanger life. In <i>R v Desmond</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>104</sup></font> Cockburn CJ said that &#8216;knowledge
or belief that life was likely to be sacrificed&#8217; made a death murder.
This may have been unduly favourable to the accused. Stephen in his
Digest did not limit bodily harm to harm likely to endanger life,
though, as counsel for the appellant pointed out, in his History of the
Criminal Law<font color="#ff0000"><sup>105</sup></font> Stephen said
that paras (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of his Article in his Digest and
para 174 of the draft Criminal Code produced by the Criminal Law
Commission 1878-79 exactly corresponded. The draft Code did not use the
words &#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217; but proposed that it would be murder if
&#8216;the offender means to cause the person killed any bodily injury which
is known to the offender to be likely to cause death&#8217;. Therefore,
counsel for the appellant contended, when Stephen referred to grievous
bodily harm he meant harm likely to cause death. This inference was the
sole foundation for this part of his argument.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">In <i>R v Ashman</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>106</sup></font> Willes J said in a case where a
man was charged with shooting with intent to do grievous bodily harm,
that it was - </p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;not necessary that such harm should have been actually done, or
that it should be either permanent or dangerous, if it be such as
seriously to interfere with comfort or health, it is sufficient.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Since then that
interpretation has in a number of cases been placed on the words
&#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217; in murder and other cases. Donovan J in <i>Director
of Public Prosecutions v Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>103</sup></font>
used it. So far from grievous bodily harm being limited to harm likely
to endanger life, since <i>R v Ashman</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>106</sup></font>
its meaning has been extended. This extension was terminated by the
decision in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith,</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>103</sup></font><i> </i>Viscount Kilmuir LC
saying that there was no want for the words a meaning other than that
which the words convey in their ordinary and natural meaning.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">If the words bore
the meaning now contended for, there must have been many murder cases
in which that was not explained to the jury and in which there was
consequently a substantial misdirection. The Royal Commission on
Capital Punishment<font color="#ff0000"><sup>107</sup></font> in their
review of the law did not suggest that the words had this limited
meaning. Indeed, in para 472<font color="#ff0000"><sup>108</sup></font>
of the report the following appears:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;We should therefore prefer to limit murder to cases where he act
by which death is caused is intended to kill or to &#8216;endanger life&#8217; or
is known to be likely to kill or endanger life. But we do not believe
that, if this change were made, it would lead to any great difference
in the day-to-day administration of the law.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">In the same
paragraph it is stated that Stephen expressed the opinion that to
substitute &#8216;bodily injury known to the offender to be likely to cause
death &#8217;,would to some extent narrow the definition. So little weight
can be attached to the inference which we are asked to draw from the
comparison of the Article in his Digest with the provisions of the
draft Criminal Code.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Our task is to say
what, in our opinion, the law is, not what it should be. In the light
of what I have said, in my opinion, the words &#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217;
must, a Viscount Kilmuir LC said, be given the ordinary and natural and
not have the gloss put on them for which the appellant contends. The
House can, it is now recognised, review its previous decisions. I see
no reason to its decision in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>109</sup></font> on the questions raised in case.
No question here arises of any objective or subjective test, for the
jury must be taken to have found that the appellant knew it as highly
probable that serious bodily harm would be caused.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">To change the law
to substitute &#8216;bodily injury known to the offender to be likely to
cause death&#8217; for &#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217; is a task that should, in my
opinion, be left to Parliament if it thinks such a change expedient. If
it is made an accused will be able to say: true it is that I intended
grievous bodily harm or that I knew such harm was likely to result but
I never intended to kill the dead man or to put his life in danger and
I did not know that by doing him serious bodily harm I would put his
life in danger. But I share the view of the majority of the Royal
Commission<font color="#ff0000"><sup>107</sup></font> that such a
change would not lead to any great difference in the day to day
administration of the law.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">For these reasons
in my opinion this appeal should be dismissed </p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><b><a
 name="diplock"></a>LORD DIPLOCK</b>. My Lords, what distinguishes
murder from manslaughter today is that murder now falls within the
class of crime in which the mental element or mens rea necessary to
constitute the offence in English law includes the attitude of mind of
the accused not only towards his physical act itself, which is the
actus rea of the offence, as is the case with manslaughter, but also
towards a particular evil consequence of that act. As I shall endeavour
to show, this was not always so. That it is so now is the consequence
of the enactment of s 1 of the Homicide Act 1957 and (if the decision
of this House in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>109</sup></font> was right) of the enactment of s
8 of the Criminal justice Act 1967.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">This appeal raises
two separate questions. The first is common to all crimes of this
class. It is: what is the attitude of mind of the accused towards the
particular evil consequence of his physical act that must be proved in
order to constitute the offence? The second is special to the crime of
murder, it is: what is the relevant evil consequence of his physical
act which causes death, towards which the attitude of mind of the
accused must be determined on a charge of murder?</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">On the first
question I do not desire to say more than that I agree with those of
your Lordships who take the uncomplicated view that in crimes of this
class no distinction is to be drawn in English law between the state of
mind of one who does an act because he desires it to produce a
particular evil consequence, and the state of mind of one who does the
act knowing full well that it is likely to produce that consequence
although it may not be the object he was seeking to achieve by doing
the act. What is common to both these states of mind is willingness to
produce the particular evil consequence: and this, in my view, is the
mens rea needed to satisfy a requirement, whether imposed by statute or
existing at common law, that in order to constitute the offence with
which the accused is charged he must have acted with &#8216;intent&#8217; to
produce a particular evil consequence or, in the ancient phrase which
still survives in crimes of homicide, with &#8216;malice aforethought&#8217;.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">I turn then to the
second question. I believe that all your Lordships are agreed that if
the English law of homicide were based on concepts that are
satisfactory, both intellectually and morally, the crime of murder
ought to be distinguished from less heinous forms of homicide by
restricting it to cases where the consequence of his act, which the
accused desired or foresaw as likely, was the death of a human being.
Where we differ is whether it is still open to this House to declare in
its judicial capacity that this is now the law of England, or whether
to define the law of murder thus would involve so basic a change in the
existing law that it could only properly be made by Act of Parliament.
For my part I think that Parliament itself has, by the Homicide Act
1957, made it constitutionally permissible for this House so to
declare, and I believe that this House ought to do so.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Any discussion of
the historical development of the law of homicide is complicated by the
varying ways in which those who wrote on this subject from the 17th
century onwards have differentiated between malice that is &#8216;express&#8217;
and malice that is &#8216;implied&#8217;. In the interests of clarity I shall
endeavour to avoid these terms and speak instead of &#8216;actual malice&#8217; and
&#8216;constructive malice&#8217;. By &#8216;actual malice&#8217; I mean the attitude of mind
of the killer towards the infliction of bodily in jury on another
person at the time he did the act that caused the death; by
&#8216;constructive malice&#8217; I mean those circumstances which until the
passing of the Homicide Act 1957 rendered killing murder without its
being necessary to enquire into the attitude of mind of the killer
towards the infliction of bodily injury on another person. For the
purposes of the present case the relevant example of &#8216;constructive
malice&#8217; is where the killing was done in the course or furtherance of
some felony other than homicide.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">I readily concede
that prior to 1957 it had become commonplace for judges (myself
included) to define the &#8216;intent&#8217; which must be proved to justify a
conviction for murder as an intent &#8216;to kill or <i>to do grievous bodily</i>
<i>harm</i>&#8217;, and that ibis practice has continued since the passing of
the Homicide Act 1957 during which period it has received the approval
of the Court of Criminal Appeal in <i>R v Vickers</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>108</sup></font> and of this House itself in <i>Director
of Public Prosecutions v Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>109</sup></font>.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">My Lords, the now
familiar expression &#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217; appears to owe its place in
the development of the English law of homicide to its use in 1803 in
Lord Ellenborough&#8217;s Act<font color="#ff0000"><sup>110</sup></font> ,
which made it a felony to shoot at, stab or cut any other person &#8216;with
intent to murder, maim, disfigure... or do some other grievous bodily
harm&#8217;. There was a proviso that if the act were committed &#8216;under such
circumstances as that if death had ensued therefrom the same would not
in law have amounted to the crime of murder&#8217; the accused was to be
acquitted of the felony. In this context the &#8216;intent&#8217; with which the
act was committed appears to be distinguished from the &#8216;circumstances&#8217;
under which it was committed and the latter to refer to such
surrounding circumstances as self-defence, a sudden falling out,
provocation or preventing an escape from lawful custody or apprehension.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">I have found no
trace of the actual expression &#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217; being used before
1803, by writers on the law of homicide or by judges, to describe what
was a sufficient evil intention to constitute that &#8216;malice
aforethought&#8217; that was the badge of murder. Apart from minor piecemeal
exceptions of assaults in particular circumstances which had been made
felonies by earlier statutes, until the passing of Lord Ellenborough&#8217;s
Act, assaults, however serious their physical consequences, were
classified as no more than misdemeanours unless they resulted in death,
if intention to cause physical injury short of death was sufficient
&#8216;malice aforethought&#8217; for the crime of murder, this must at that time
have been because it was &#8216;actual malice&#8217; and not &#8216;constructive malice'
implied by law when the act that caused the death was done in the
course of furtherance of some other felony.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The felony created
by Lord Ellenborough&#8217;s Act was one in which the intent with which the
physical act was done was a necessary ingredient of the offence: but
the intent here, unlike that needed to constitute actual malice in the
offence or murder, was defined in the statute itself. Consequently
after the passing of Lord Ellenborough&#8217;s Act, wherever the act that
caused the death was shooting&#8217; stabbing or cutting, it became
constructive malice and so made the killing murder if the intent with
which the act was done was to do any &#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217; within the
meaning of the statute. This provision was re-enacted in 1828<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>111</sup></font> and remained in force until it
was replaced by s 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 which
extended the felonious offence to causing grievous bodily harm by any
means if done &#8216;with intent to maim, disfigure or disable... or to do
some other grievous bodily harm&#8217;, and omitted the proviso.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The expression
&#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217; in the earlier statutes had been construed by
Graham B in <i>R v Cox</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>112</sup></font>
and Willes J in <i>R v Ashman</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>113</sup></font>.
In the words of Willes J.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>114</sup></font>:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;It is not necessary that such harm ... should be either permanent
or dangerous, if it be such as seriously to interfere with comfort or
health, it is sufficient.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Until the decision
of this House in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>109</sup></font> this statement of Willes J. had
been accepted as authoritative on the meaning of this expression in the
Offences Against the Person Act 1861 which was passed shortly after it.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Neither <i>R v Cox</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>112</sup></font> nor <i>R v Ashman</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>113</sup></font> was concerned with a charge of
murder: but the effect of the acceptance of Willes J&#8217;s definition was
to make it constructive malice sufficient to support a charge of murder
if the act that caused the death was done with the intent seriously to
interfere with the comfort or health of any even though that act was
not one foreseen as being in the least likely to endanger life.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">In the result, so
long as the doctrine of constructive malice continued to be part of the
English law of murder, it ceased to matter whether the actual intent
with which the act that caused the death was done was an intent to do
&#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217; within the meaning of the successive statutes or
some more heinous intent that might have had to be proved in order to
show actual malice sufficient to constitute the crime of murder at
common law. So where, as in the generality of murder charges, the
prosecution did not rely on the intent of the accused to commit some
other felony such as robbery, rape or abortion, but relied solely on
his intent to do physical harm to any person, the distinction between
constructive malice and actual malice had no practical consequences and
in course of time came to be overlooked.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">In 1957 all this
was altered. The doctrine of constructive malice was abolished by s 1
of the Homicide Act 1957. So it was no longer sufficient on a charge of
murder to prove that the accused had killed another person in the
course or in furtherance of the statutory offence under s 18 of the
Offences against the Person Act 1861 for which the only intent
necessary was an intent to &#8216;do grievous bodily harm&#8217; as that expression
in the statute had been construed by the courts. It became necessary to
prove that his intent was such as would have amounted to actual malice
at common law if none of the statutes from Lord Ellenborough&#8217;s Act
onwards had been passed. </p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The passing of the
Homicide Act 1957 thus required the courts to embark on an enquiry in
which the first step was to ascertain in what terms judges were juries
at the close of the 18th century as to the state of mind of the accused
which had to be proved to sustain a charge of murder on the ground of
actual malice. If that were the end of the enquiry, however, and judges
were again to direct juries in the same terms as their 18th century
predecessors, the effect of the passing of the Homicide Act 1957 would
have been to set back the clock 200 years. To do this would frustrate
the underlying principle which is the justification for retaining the
common law as a living source of rules binding on all members of
society in England. The rules of which it is the source. cannot be
unchanging. In the field of crime their purpose is to discourage
conduct which is commonly accepted by Englishmen to be harmful to
society in the circumstances in which men and women live today; not in
the circumstances of two centuries ago. They must reflect contemporary
views of what is just, what is moral, what is humane, and not those
current in an earlier and more primitive or violent age. For unless
they do, the system of criminal justice will break down. The unique
combination of the functions of judge and jury in a criminal trial, the
absence of any means of impugning a jury&#8217;s verdict of acquittal, or of
questioning a direction by the judge which states the law in a way
unduly favourable to the accused, have the practical consequence, that
effect is not given to a criminal law if it outrages the instinctive
sense of justice of judges and of juries alike.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">So with the
passing of the Homicide Act 1957 the courts were faced with a dual
task: first, to discover as a matter of historical research what state
of mind of the accused was regarded by the 18th century judges as
constituting actual malice for the purposes of the crime of murder;
and, secondly, to decide in what respects the views on this matter of
subsequent generations of judges, if all of them were wise, would have
been modified to take account of the way in which material
circumstances and social concepts had been developed throughout the
19th and 20th centuries - a task which presents a challenge without
precedent to the wisdom of those on whom this decision rests.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The material for
the task of historical research is scanty. There was no systematic
contemporaneous reporting of criminal trials before the 19th century.
There was no check on how individual judges directed juries on the
criminal law, unless the judge himself chose to reserve a point of law
for the informal consideration of his brother judges at Serjeant&#8217;s Inn
- and even such reports as there are of the opinions expressed by all
the judges on points of law which were reserved, are sparse and
haphazard. The major sources of information are the works of
institutional writers on the subject, starting with Coke in 1612,
followed by Hale in 1685, by Foster J. in 1762 and finishing with East
in 1803. They were the subject of detailed critical analysis by Sir
James Stephen in the 19th century in his Digest of the Criminal Law
written in 1887 and History of Criminal Law written in 1883.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">If what was
written before the 19th century about the degree of violence that must
have been intended by the accused in order to support a charge of
murder is to be properly understood, there are several matters to be
borne in mind.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">(1) It must be
remembered that, judged by present day standards, we are dealing with a
violent age. Men were used to carry deadly weapons and not slow to
resort to them. So, at the beginning of the period Coke did not
classify as murder a killing on &#8216;a sudden falling out&#8217;. Later when this
defence became merged in the general doctrine of provocation most of
the cases with which the writers were preoccupied involved the use of
deadly weapons and it is not without significance that Lord
Ellenborough&#8217;s Act itself was concerned only with shooting, stabbing
and cutting.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">(2) Medical and
surgical science were in a very primitive state. Any bodily injury,
particularly if it involved risk of sepsis through an open wound, might
well prove mortal although today the likelihood of its resulting in
death would be insignificant. It was not until the last quarter of the
19th century that antiseptics came into general use.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">(3) Until the 19th
century the common law did not recognise unconsummated attempts to
commit a crime as being criminal offences in themselves. So in relation
to the crime of murder judges were dealing with bodily injuries which
had in fact been fatal, and so demonstrated to have been of a kind
which could endanger life.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">(4) As stated by
Sir Michael Foster it was accepted law in the 18th century that once
the fact of killing was proved the onus lay on the prisoner to prove
facts negativing malice aforethought unless such facts arose out of the
evidence produced against him.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">(5) Until as late
as 1898 persons accused of murder were incompetent to give evidence in
their own defence. So the actual intent with which they had done the
act which had in fact caused death could only be a matter of inference
from the evidence of other witnesses as to what the accused had done or
said. In drawing this inference from what he had done it was necessary
to assume that the accused was gifted with the foresight and reasoning
capacity of a &#8216;reasonable man&#8217; and, as such, must have foreseen as a
possible consequence of his act, and this within his intention,
anything which, in the ordinary course of events, might result from it.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Bearing these
considerations in mind, I, for my part, find it to say with confidence
whether or not by the close of this period judges, when in connection
with malice aforethought they used various expressions connoting
physical injuries, did so with the unexpressed major premise in mind:
&#8216;All physical injuries at any rate if they are serious, are likely to
&#8216;endanger life&#8217; and so equated intent to cause serious physical
injuries with intent to endanger life. Probably they did not at the
beginning of the period. Hale thought that an intent to do <i>any </i>bodily
harm to another was sufficient. The rigour of this doctrine had,
however, been modified by the time of Foster. He considered that there
must be an intent to do <i>great</i> bodily harm, and some light on
what he meant by this may perhaps be found in his explanation of a
verdict of manslaughter as being justified because the death resulted
from a stroke by a cudgel <i>not likely to kill</i>. Stephen in his
Digest of the Criminal Law<font color="#ff0000"><sup>114</sup></font>
regards this as a land-mark. He says of Foster that he-</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;may be regarded as having laid down the foundation of the modem
doctrine, on the subject, which has since his time been recognised in a
vast number of cases, that the general presumption of malice which
arises from the fact of killing is rebutted if <i>it appears that the
means used were not likely to cause death.&#8217;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">East<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>115</sup></font>, writing in the year that Lord
Ellenborough&#8217;s Act was passed, defines &#8216;malice aforethought express&#8217; as
&#8216;where the deliberate Purpose of the Perpetrator was to deprive another
of Life, or do him some great bodily Harm.&#8217; But in discussing the
relevance of the manner of procuring the death, which under the then
existing law would constitute the principal material from which the
inference of malice would be drawn, he says<font color="#ff0000"><sup>116</sup></font>:
&#8216;But he who wilfully and deliberately does <i>any act which apparently
endangers another&#8217;s life</i>, and thereby occasions his death, shall,
unless he clearly prove the contrary, be adjudged to kill him of malice
prepense.&#8217; So East, whether consciously or not, appears to treat
inflicting &#8216;great bodily harm&#8217; as the same a thing as doing an act
which endangers life.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">In their Fourth
Report the Commissioners on Criminal Law writing in 1839 treated as
self-evident the proposition that all serious physical injuries are
likely to endanger life. In their prefatory remarks on homicide they
wrote<font color="#ff0000"><sup>117</sup></font>:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;Neither is there any difference between the direct intention to
kill and the intention to do some great bodily harm short of death&#8230; as
no one can wilfully do great bodily harm without placing life in
jeopardy.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">This led them to
conclude<font color="#ff0000"><sup>118 </sup></font>: &#8216;It is the <i>wilful
exposure</i> of life to that constitutes the crime [sc murder]&#8217;. And
even as late as 1883 Stephen in his History of the Criminal Law, when
comparing his own previous digest with the draft code, proposed by the
Criminal Code Commissioners, of whom he himself was one, felt able to
say<font color="#ff0000"><sup>119</sup></font> &#8216;that the two exactly
correspond&#8217;, although in the Digest he had defined the relevant
intention as an intention &#8216;&#8230; to cause grievous bodily harm&#8217; whereas in
the draft code it was defined as an intention &#8216;to cause&#8230; any bodily
injury which is known to the offender to be likely to cause death.&#8217;</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">As a final
footnote bringing the matter into the 20th century, it appears from
para 106 of the Report of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>120</sup></font> published in 1953, that Lord
Goddard CJ and Humphreys J, who supported the proposal that a person
ought not to be liable to be convicted of murder unless he had
intentionally or knowingly endangered life, had &#8216;suggested a definition
in terms of the infliction or grievous bodily harm because they held
that <i>a person who wittingly inflicts grievous bodily harm must know
that he is endangering</i> <i>life</i>...&#8217; Lord Goddard CJ is reported
(para 472<font color="#ff0000"><sup>121 </sup></font>) as having told
the commission that under the existing law he would direct a jury to
that effect.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">My Lords, even if
the first step towards the solution of the problem with which the
courts were confronted by the statutory abolition of the doctrine of
constructive malice does not lead to a confident conclusion that judges
at the close of the 18th century would only have regarded as sufficient
to constitute the actual malice needed for the crime of murder an
intention to inflict bodily injury if the intended injury was such as
in the existing state of medical skill and science it was likely to
endanger life, any difficulty created by this is, I think, resolved
when one proceeds to the second step, viz. a consideration of how the
law in this matter would have developed in the 19th and 20th centuries
if there had been no doctrine of constructive malice.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Since the first
Commissioners on the Criminal Law issued their Fourth Report in 1839,
it has been the uniform view of those who have assumed or been charged
with the task of codifying the law of homicide that the relevant
intention on a charge of murder should be an intention to kill or to
cause any bodily injury which is known to the offender to be likely to
endanger life. Such was the view expressed by the Criminal Code
Commissioners in 1879, by Stephen in 1877and 1883, by the Royal
Commission on Capital Punishment in 1953 and by the Law Commission in
1966. The significance of the citations that I have already made from
all but the last of these is that they show that it was the opinion of
these eminent lawyers at the various dates when they were writing that
this would involve a rationalisation of the existing common law rather
than any change in it. I have no doubt that the judges in the course of
the 19th and 20th centuries would have held this to be the law as to
express malice had they not been diverted from doing so by the doctrine
of constructive malice.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The opportunity of
doing so, however, did not arise until the Homicide Act 1957 was passed
and <i>R v</i> <i>Vickers</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>122</sup></font><i>
</i>came before the Court of Criminal Appeal. The judge had directed
the jury in the same terms as he would have done before the passing of
the 1957 Act, viz. that murder is killing with the intent to kill or to
do grievous bodily harm. In dismissing the appeal Lord Goddard CJ said
that killing with that intention had always been malice aforethought in
English law. As I have endeavoured to show this is historically
inaccurate. The actual expression &#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217; did not come
into use until the passing of Lord Ellenborough&#8217;s Act, when under the
doctrine of constructive malice a killing in the course of committing
an offence under that Act or any of its successors became murder. On
the other hand, if &#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217; meant, as Lord Goddard CJ
appears to have thought it did when he gave evidence before the Royal
Commission on Capital Punishment a few years before, &#8216;bodily harm
likely to endanger life&#8217;, this statement of the law is accurate. Where
it is liable to be misleading, however, is that it uses a phrase taken
from a statutory definition of a different offence which, in cases
relating to that different offence, had been construed in accordance
with the direction of Willes J. in <i>R v</i> <i>Ashman</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>123</sup></font> as including bodily harm which
temporarily, albeit seriously, interfered with comfort or health,
although as a result of the advance of medical skill and knowledge it
was not in the least likely to endanger life.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">It proved to be
misleading when the matter came before this House in <i>Director of
Public Prosecutions v</i> <i>Smith</i>.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>124</sup></font>
That case is best remembered and most criticised for its apparent
acceptance of what has come to be known as the objective test of that
element in mens rea which involves intending or foreseeing the
consequences of an act done voluntarily. This part of the judgment has
been overruled by s 8 of the Criminal justice Act 1967; but in <i>Director
of Public Prosecutions v Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>124</sup></font>
this House also approved as a definition of the intention required to
constitute the crime of murder &#8216;an intention to kill&#8217; or to cause
&#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217;, giving to &#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217; the same
meaning in this definition as it bears in s 18 of the Offences against
the Person Act 1861.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">In his speech
Viscount Kilmuir LC rejected the submission that in cases of murder the
expression &#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217;, if used in the definition of the
relevant intent, should be understood in the restricted sense of bodily
harm &#8216;obviously dangerous to life&#8217; or &#8216;likely to kill&#8217;, though he
acknowledged that it had been used in this restricted sense in many of
the cases. While rejecting this restricted construction he also
rejected the wide construction propounded by Willes J in <i>R v Ashman</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>123</sup></font>. &#8216;Grievous bodily harm&#8217; in his
view meant &#8216;really serious bodily harm&#8217; - neither more nor less.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">My Lords, this
House in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>124</sup></font> considered, in my view rightly,
that it was still open to it in 1961 in its judicial capacity to define
the mens rea required to constitute the common law crime of murder
after the doctrine of constructive malice had been abolished by Act of
Parliament. If that be so, it has in my opinion been open to this House
since it assumed the power in 1966 to overrule its previous decisions,
to refuse to follow this part of Viscount Kilmuir LC&#8217;s speech in <i>Director
of Public Prosecutions v</i> <i>Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>125</sup></font>,
if we are satisfied that it is wrong in law, is liable to cause
injustice and offends concepts of what is right and what is wrong that
command a general acceptance in contemporary society.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">For my part, I am
satisfied that the decision of this House in <i>Director of Public
Prosecutions v Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>125</sup></font> was
wrong insofar as it rejected the submission that in order to amount to
the crime of murder the offender, if he did not intend to kill, must
have intended or foreseen as a likely consequence of his act that human
life would be endangered. I have already given at some length the
reasons why I think so. I will not repeat them. I think the reason why
this House fell into error was because it failed to appreciate that the
concept of &#8216;intention to do grievous bodily harm&#8217; only became relevant
to the common law crime of murder as a result of the passing of Lord
Ellen borough&#8217;s Act in I803 and the application to the new felony-
thereby created of the then current common law doctrine of constructive
malice. This led this House to approach the problem as one of the
proper construction of the words &#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217; which because,
though <i>only</i> because, of the doctrine of constructive malice had
over the past 100 years become part of the standard definition of mens
rea in murder, as well as part of the statutory definition of mens rea
in the statutory felony of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to
cause grievous bodily harm. I do not question that in the statutory
offence &#8216;grievous bodily harm&#8217; bears the meaning ascribed to it by this
House in <i>Director of Public</i> <i>Prosecutions v Smith</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>125</sup></font> but the actual problem which
confronted this House in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions</i> <i>v
Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>125</sup></font> and the Court of
Criminal Appeal in <i>R v Vickers</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>126</sup></font>
was a much more complex one. What it involved, I have endeavoured to
analyse earlier in my speech.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">It was, I venture
to think, a comparable failure to appreciate the significance of the
accidents of history in the development of English criminal law that
led this House in the same case to adopt the objective test of
intention as to the consequences of a voluntary act, i.e. that part of
the decision that is now overruled by the Criminal justice Act 1967.
Intention can only be subjective. It was the actual intention of the
offender himself that the objective rest was designed to ascertain. So
long as the offender was not permitted to give evidence of what his
actual intention was, the objective test provided the only way,
imperfect though it might be, of ascertaining this. The Criminal
Evidence Act 1898 changed all this. A defendant to a charge of felony
became entitled to give evidence in his own defence. The objective test
no longer provided the only means available in a criminal trial of
ascertaining the actual intention of the offender: but it had been so
for so long, that this House overlooked the historical fact that the
objective test did not define the relevant intention as to the
consequences of a voluntary act. It was no more than one means of
ascertaining the relevant intention, to which the Criminal Evidence Act
1898 added another - the defendant&#8217;s own evidence of what his actual
intention was.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">My Lords, if a
decision of this House is founded on a proposition of law which is
erroneous in a respect which makes it bear too harshly on a defendant
to a criminal charge, particularly where that charge is one of murder,
I have no doubt that your Lordships are entitled to correct that
proposition and to apply it in its corrected form. I think that your
Lordships ought to do so. That all your Lordships are agreed that the
law as to the relevant intent in the common law crime of murder ought
to be as I have endeavoured to state it; that that was also the view of
successive Commissions who have considered this topic between 1839 and
1966 and of Sir James Stephen, satisfies me that to leave this error
uncorrected would offend concepts of what is light and what is wrong
that command general acceptance in contemporary society. If your
Lordships were to take this course it would involve allowing this
appeal: for although Ackner J&#8217;s direction to the jury was correct as
respects the attitude of mind of the appellant towards the particular
evil consequences of her physical act that must be proved in order to
constitute the crime of murder, he followed the decision of this House
in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v</i> <i>Smith</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>125</sup></font> in his direction as to the
nature of those particular evil consequences. So he stated them too
broadly. The respondent does not invite this House to apply the proviso
to S 2(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, and your Lordships have
heard no argument about it.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">For my part I
would allow the appeal and substitute a verdict of guilty of
manslaughter for the verdict of guilty of murder. </p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><b><a name="cross"></a>LORD
CROSS OF CHELSEA</b>. My Lords, Ackner J directed the jury in the
following terms:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;The prosecution must prove, beyond all reasonable doubt, that the
accused intended to (kill or) do serious bodily harm to Mrs. Booth, the
mother of the deceased girls. If you are satisfied that when the
accused set fire to the house she knew that it was highly probable that
would cause (death or) serious bodily harm then the prosecution will
have established the necessary intent. It matters not if her motive
was, as she says, to frighten Mrs. Booth.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">As the jury
returned a verdict of guilty they must have been satisfied that the
appellant when she set fire to the house realised at the least that it
was highly probable that one or more of the inmates would suffer
serious bodily harm. On the other hand, it must be assumed in her
favour that they thought that motive - in the sense of the object which
she wished to achieve by her act - may not have been to inflict serious
bodily harm on Mrs. Booth or anyone else but to frighten her away from
Coventry. It is conceded that the judge did not fall into the error of
inviting the jury to consider the appellant's state of mind
&#8216;objectively.&#8217; He told them to ask themselves what &#8216;<i>she</i>&#8217;
realised, not what a normal woman would have realised, would be the
likely result of her act. Further, there is no question of he having
acted &#8216;recklessly&#8217; in the sense of not having reflected on the probable
consequences of her act. The verdict negatives &#8216;recklessness&#8217; in this
sense. The question we are asked to answer is, therefore, as I see it,
whether sub-para (<i>b</i>) of art 223 of Digest of the Criminal Law<font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>127</sup></font> states the law correctly. That
article - so far as relevant for present purposes - runs as follows:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
  <p>&#8216;Murder is unlawful homicide with malice aforethought. Malice
aforethought means... (<i>a</i>) an intention to cause the death of, or
grievous bodily harm to, any person, whether such person is the person
actually killed or not; (<i>b</i>) Knowledge that the act which causes
death will probably cause the death of, or grievous bodily harm to,
some person, whether such person is the actually killed or not,
although such knowledge is accompanied by indifference whether death or
grievous bodily harm is caused or not, or by a wish it may not be
caused&#8230;&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">I agree with my
noble and learned friend, Lord Kilbrandon, that now that murder no
longer attracts the death penalty it would be logical to replace the
two crimes of murder and manslaughter by a single offence of unlawful
homicide; but there are considerations, in which logic plays little
part, which tell against the making of such a change - and as long as
one has the two separate crimes one has to decide on which side of the
line any given state of mind falls. Stephen&#8217;s definition covers four
states of mind. A(1) an intent to kill, (2) knowledge that the act in
question will probably cause death. B(1) an intent to cause grievous
bodily harm, (2) knowledge that the act in question will probably cause
grievous bodily harm. Counsel for the appellant argued strenuously that
there was a great gulf fixed between A(1) and B(1) on the one hand, and
A(2) and B(2) on the other, and that unless the accused believed that
the consequences in question were certain to ensue one ought not to
equate mere foresight of consequences with an intention to produce
them. Even if one views the matter simply from the point of view of
linguistics I am not sure that the ordinary man would agree. If, for
example, someone parks a car in a city street with a time bomb in it
which explodes and injures a number of people I think that the ordinary
man might well argue as follows: &#8216;The man responsible for this outrage
did not injure these people unintentionally; he injured them
intentionally. So he can fairly he said to have intentionally injured
them-that is to say, to have intended to injure them. The fact that he
was not certain that anyone would be injured is quite irrelevant; -
(after all, how could he possibly be certain that anyone would be
injured?) - and the fact that, although he foresaw that it was likely
that some people would be injured, it was a matter of indifference to
him whether they were injured or not (his object being simply to call
attention to Irish grievances and to demonstrate the power of the IRA)
is equally irrelevant.&#8217; But I can see that a logician might object that
the ordinary man was using the word &#8216;intentionally&#8217; with two different
shades of meaning. and I am prepared to assume that as a matter of the
correct use of language the man in question did not intend to injure
those who were in fact injured by his act. But we are not debating a
problem of linguistics; we are asking ourselves whether Stephen was
right in saying that the states of mind labelled A(2) and B(2)
constitute &#8216;malice aforethought&#8217;. The first question to be answered is
whether if an intention to kill-using intention in the strict sense of
the word is murder as it plainly is - doing an unlawful act with
knowledge that it may well cause death ought also to be murder. I have
no doubt whatever that it ought to be. On this point I agree entirely
with the view expressed by Cockburn CJ in the passage in his summing-up
in <i>R v Desmond</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>128</sup></font> which
is quoted by my noble and learned friend, Lord Hailsham of St
Marylebone. Turning now to the states of mind labelled B(1) and (2)-if
it is the law that an intention to cause grievous bodily harm-using
intention in the strict sense of the word-is &#8216;malice aforethought&#8217;,
whether or not one realises that one&#8217;s act may endanger life, then I
think that it is right that the doing of an act which one realises may
well cause grievous bodily harm should also constitute malice
aforethought whether or nor one realises that one&#8217;s act may endanger
life. No doubt many people think that Stephen&#8217;s four categories ought
to be reduced to two ("namely, an intention to kill and a willingness
to endanger life", and my noble and learned friend, Lord Diplock, whose
speech I have had the advantage of reading, thinks that since the
passing of the Homicide Act 1957 it has been open to the courts to
declare that this is in fact the law. But to achieve that result it
would be necessary for us to overrule <i>R v Vickers</i><font
 color="#ff0000"><sup>129</sup></font> and that part of the decision in
<i>Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>130</sup></font>
which approved <i>R v Vickers</i>.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>129</sup></font>.
For the reasons which I give in the second part of this opinion, I do
not think that we ought to consider doing that in this case and so I
think that we should for present purposes accept Stephen&#8217;s art 223(<i>a</i>)
and (<i>b</i>) as a correct statement of the law. Although judges have
generally only used sub-para (<i>a</i>) in their directions to juries,
sub-para (<i>b</i>) has been sometimes used, as for example, by Avory J
in <i>R v Lumley</i>.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>131</sup></font>
Counsel did not refer us to any case in which any doubt has been thrown
on its correctness and it was accepted as correct in the Supreme Court
of Victoria in <i>R v Jakac</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>132</sup></font>.
In the result, therefore, I think that the only criticism which can be
directed against Ackner J&#8217;s summing-up is that by the insertion of the
word &#8216;highly&#8217; before &#8216;probable&#8217; it was unduly favourable to the
appellant.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">It was not until
counsel for the appellant was in the middle of his reply that I
appreciated that he was contending as an alternative to his main
argument that <i>R v Vickers</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>129</sup></font>
had been wrongly decided. My failure to appreciate this may well have
been partly due to the fact that I have never before had to grapple
with this obscure and highly technical branch of the law, but the fact
that counsel for the Crown did not deal with this point at all in his
argument is some indication that counsel, if he was intending to make
it in his opening, did not lay much stress on it at that stage.
Moreover, although by the close of the argument I could see that it was
a serious point it was only when I read the speech of my noble and
learned friend, Lord Diplock, that I fully appreciated the historical
and logical basis for it. Briefly the argument as I understand it, runs
as follow-that the Court of Criminal Appeal was wrong when it said in <i>R
v Vickers</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>133</sup></font> that an
intention to inflict grievous bodily harm had itself &#8216;<i>always</i>&#8217;
supplied the necessary &#8216;malice&#8217; to support a conviction for murder
whether or not the accused realised that what he was doing was likely
to endanger life; that such an intention only came to supply the
necessary malice after the intentional infliction of grievous bodily
harm had been made a felony by Lord Ellenborough&#8217;s Act; that
accordingly what came to be the common form direction that an intention
to do grievous bodily harm constituted &#8216;malice aforethought&#8217; was,
whether those who used it realised the fact or not, only justified by
the doctrine of constructive malice and that, whether or not it
realised what it was doing, Parliament when it abolished constructive
malice by the Homicide Act 1957 in effect swept away the existing law
of &#8216;malice aforethought&#8217; in cases in which an intent to kill could not
be proved and left it to the courts to refine the mental element
requisite in such cases to support a conviction for murder. My noble
and learned friend may be right. On the other hand, my noble and
learned friend, Viscount Dilhorne, whose speech I have also had the
advantage of reading, thinks that he is wrong-and he may be right in so
thinking. All that I am certain of is that I am not prepared to decide
between them without having heard the fullest possible argument on the
paint from counsel on both sides - especially as a decision that <i>R v</i>
<i>Vickers</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>133</sup></font> was wrongly
decided might have serious repercussions since the direction approved
in that case must have been given in many homicide cases in the last 17
years. For my part, therefore, I shall content myself with saving that <i>on
the footing that</i> <i>R v Vickers</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>133</sup></font>
<i>was rightly decided</i> the answer to the question put to us should
be &#8216;Yes&#8217; and that this appeal should be dismissed.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><b><a
 name="kilbrandon"></a>LORD KILBRANDON</b>. My Lords, having had the
advantage of reading the speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord
Diplock, I have no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that to kill
with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm is murder only if
grievous bodily harm means some injury which is likely to cause death:
if murder is to be found proved in the absence of an intention to kill,
the jury must be satisfied from the nature of the act itself or from
the evidence that the accused knew that death was a likely consequence
of the act and was indifferent whether that consequence followed or
not. It is because I regard the adoption of a fresh definition of the
intention, beyond an intention to kill, necessary to support a charge
of murder as inevitably called for by the passing into law of the
Homicide Act 1957 that I have come to the conclusion that this House is
entitled to declare the common law basis on which the rule laid down by
Parliament rests, rather than leaving it to Parliament itself to do so.
It is a satisfaction to me to be able to say that in my opinion such a
declaration would be in conformity with the common law of Scotland,
where constructive malice has never formed part of the law of murder.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">My Lords, it is
not so easy to feel satisfaction at the doubts and difficulties which
seem to surround the crime of murder and the distinguishing from it of
the crime of manslaughter. There is something wrong when crimes of such
gravity, and I will say of such familiarity, call for the display of so
formidable a degree of forensic and judicial learning as the present
case has given rise to. I believe this to show that a more radical look
at the problem is called for, and was called for immediately on the
passing of the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965. Until that
time the content of murder-and I am not talking about the definition of
murder-was that form of homicide which is punishable with death. (It is
not necessary to notice the experimental period during which capital
murder and non-capital murder existed side-by-side.) Since no homicides
are now punishable with death, these many hours and days have been
occupied in trying to adjust a definition of that which has no content.
There does not appear to be any good reason why the crimes of murder
and manslaughter should not both be abolished, and the single crime of
unlawful homicide substituted; one case will differ from another in
gravity, and that can be taken care of by variation of sentences
downwards from life imprisonment. It is no longer true, if it was ever
true, to say that murder, as we now define it, is necessarily the most
heinous example of unlawful homicide. The present case could form an
excellent example exhibiting as it does, assuming it to be capable of
classification as manslaughter, a degree of cold-blooded cruelty
exceeding that. to be found in many an impulsive crime which could
never, on our present law, be so classified.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">My Lords, since
the passage in the summing-up of the learned judge which was
particularly noticed is not consistent with the common law, as it has
now, as I agree, been shown to be, and the proviso was not relied on,
it follows that this appeal should be allowed.</p>
