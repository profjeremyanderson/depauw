this guide is about writing papers <span style="font-style: italic;">for
me</span>. Other
instructors--including other philosophy instructors--may have different
expectations, and they are entitled to grade your work based on
their expectations. If you are writing a paper for someone besides me,
confer with that instructor before, or instead of, relying on this

 name="2"></a>2. Two kinds of papers</font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
<br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Most papers I will
assign will be either <span style="font-weight: bold;">expository </span>or
<span style="font-weight: bold;">argumentative</span>.</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
<br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">In an <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">expository
</span>paper, your job is to explain something. For example, I may give
you a piece of text and ask you to explain what it means. I might also
ask you to critique the text some, but the main task is to
explain it, making its meaning as clear as possible.</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
<br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">In an <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">argumentative
</span>paper, your main task is to critique something. For example, you
may be
asked to critically evaluate a philosophical argument from the book or
from class. Your main job then is to present your own case for why
that argument is good (that is, sound or plausible) if you think it is
good, or why it is bad (that is, unsound or implausible) if you think
it is bad. In the course of your critique you may need to explain
(i.e., do some
exposition of) what you are criticizing, but the exposition is
secondary
to the critique. So, if the assignment is to write an argumentative
paper but your paper is mostly exposition, it is probably not a good
paper.</span></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">

<font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">A good
undergraduate
philosophical paper will usually have at least two main parts. It will
have an <span style="font-weight: bold;">introduction</span> and a <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">body</span>; often but not necessarily
always, it will also have a
<span style="font-weight: bold;">conclusion</span>.</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
<br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">This three-part
structure can be summarized as, <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Tell
them what you&#8217;re going to say;
then say it; then tell them what you just said.&#8221;</span> This may seem
ridiculous: why say it three times? The reason is that each part of the
paper serves a different purpose, requiring you to communicate with
readers in a different way. Doing this is actually a good way to
convey scholarly ideas in writing. It works.</span></font><br

<font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Let me tell you
what an introduction's purpose is, give some tips on how to get
started, and give an example of writing and revising one.</span></font><br

The introduction's purpose.<br>
</span></span></font>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
purpose of your introduction is to allow a reader to <span
 style="font-style: italic;">quickly
</span>determine whether your paper is of interest. </span>In
academia,
scholars come
across hundreds of papers, far more than we have time to read. So it is
important to enable readers to discern what your paper is about without
having to read all of it.</span></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"></font><font style="font-family: Georgia;" size="-1">
Your introduction
should let readers know two things: what your topic is and what you are
going to say about it. Therefore, it should have two main parts: a
<span style="font-weight: bold;">brief discussion of your topic</span>,
and your <span style="font-weight: bold;">thesis statement</span>.</font><font
 size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> That is all.&nbsp; </span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"></font><font size="-1"><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Your
</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Georgia;">topic </span>will
generally
be</span></font><font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">
something you want to explain or
clarify (if your paper is expository)</span></font><font size="-1"><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;">, or</span></font><font size="-1"><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;"> some philosophical problem or issue you
will try to solve
(if your paper is argumentative). You don&#8217;t want to go on and on
about it; that would defeat the introduction&#8217;s purpose. This part of
your introduction should be as brief and to the point as you can make
it, especially in a short paper.</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
<br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Your <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">thesis
statement</span> is a summary of what you are going to say about your
topic.
It tells your reader what the main point of your paper is:</span></font><font
 size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> if your paper is
expository, it states what
you think is the most important thing to know about what you will be
explaining</span></font><font size="-1"><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;">; or,</span></font><font size="-1"><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;"> in an
argumentative paper, it states your solution to the problem or your
position on the issue. Whether your paper is argumentative or
expository, your
thesis statement also gives a brief summary of how you intend to
support your thesis: the main points you are going to make to argue for
it. </span></font><font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Think
of
this
summary
as giving your reader a road map to the rest of your
paper. In
keeping with the
purpose of an introduction, keep your introduction succinct. (If you
don&#8217;t know
what &#8220;succinct&#8221; means, <a
 href="http://www.answers.com/topic/succinctness">look it up now</a>.)</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
<br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Since the
introduction is supposed to tell a reader what you're going to do and
how you will do it, it is a sort of promise to your reader. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">You must
keep this promise. </span>If the rest of your paper does not match
what your
introduction says, you must revise the introduction, or the rest of the
paper, or both, until they match.</span></font><br

Tips on getting started. </span><br>
</span></font>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;">Suppose the assignment
is to
write a 3-page/~1100-word paper evaluating Descartes&#8217; first argument
for God's existence in his <span style="font-style: italic;">Meditations
on
First
Philosophy</span>.</span></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">This prompt asks
you to write an argumentative paper about a particular argument in the
text. This suggests certain questions you need to ask yourself. You
should ask these sorts of questions with regard to any argumentative
paper assignment:</span></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<br style="font-family: Georgia;">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><font size="-1"><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;">1. Do you know
<span style="font-weight: bold;">which </span>argument the prompt is
referring to? Can you find exactly where
it is in the book? If not, ask!</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">2. Do you
<span style="font-weight: bold;">understand </span>that argument? If
not, re-read it. Try to figure it out
using the text, and your notes if it was discussed in class. If you are
still mystified, seek help! Set up an appointment to see me, and soon.</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">3. Once you
understand the argument well, do you <span style="font-weight: bold;">agree
</span>with it? In other words,
does Descartes come to the correct conclusion, and do his reasons
provide solid support for that conclusion (i.e., is his argument <a
 href="101+213_logic.html#5">sound</a>)?</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">4. Your answer
should be be either "Yes" or "No." If it is "Maybe," consider the
argument
more carefully, since any argument either is sound or is not. If you
can't decide, come see me. Regardless of what your answer is, ask: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Why?</span> Imagine
your friend disagrees with you. What would you say to convince her of
your
answer?</span></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br
 style="font-family: Georgia; font-weight: bold;">
<font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Your answer to #4
is the starting point of your paper.</span> In the process of writing
your
paper you will have to think carefully about it, and this will most
likely lead you to change your mind a little or a lot about it. (At the
very least you will have to refine how you present your ideas.) That is
fine. It's called "learning," and it is supposed to happen. When it
does, you will need to revise your paper accordingly. But that's later;
this is a place to start.</span></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">You may find it
helpful to start by writing out your answers to #4 in some detail. When
you do this, you are sketching the body of the paper. That is fine:
it's often good to write the body first and make sure it is clear and
logical, and then write the introduction and conclusion afterwards.</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
</div>
<br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font style="font-weight: bold;" size="-1"><span

example of how you might write an introduction for this paper.</span></font><br

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><font size="-1"><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;">Let's suppose I
believe Descartes' argument is bad. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Here
is
a first draft of an
introduction:</span></span></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;">Like many of us,
Descartes is dissatisfied with the quality of knowledge he had learned
previously. He is filled with doubts. But rather than living as a
skeptic, he wants to find a firm and lasting foundation for knowledge
(Descartes 147). He begins by finding a few powerful reasons to doubt
all his
previous beliefs. He hopes that, by overcoming all of these doubts, he
will establish such a foundation (145, 150). Among those doubts is what
later scholars have dubbed &#8220;defective nature doubt&#8221;: the possibility
that God&#8212;an all-powerful, all-knowing being&#8212;is deceiving him or,
alternatively, that there is no God and he, Descartes, is the product
of mere chance and thus is naturally prone to error (149). However
unlikely these possibilities may be, even the slightest possibility of
them suffices to cast doubt on all of his beliefs: for any belief he
has, it may be that God is tricking him into believing it even though
it is false, or perhaps he believes it only because he is naturally
defective. To dispel defective nature doubt, then, Descartes decides he
must establish both that God exists and that God is not a deceiver
(154-5). For if God exists, then Descartes cannot be the product of
mere chance; and if God is no deceiver, then God would not trick him.
Descartes has several arguments for God&#8217;s existence in the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Meditations</span>;
in this paper I will focus on the first argument in the Third
Meditation (156-8). I will argue that it is unsound.</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
      </div>
      <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <font style="font-weight: bold;" size="-1"><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;">Okay: using what I
said above about what an introduction should do, can you tell me what&#8217;s
good and what&#8217;s bad about this one without peeking at what I say about
it? Try.</span></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Here is
what&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: bold;">good
      </span>about it. Most importantly, it contains the necessary
parts of an
introduction: a discussion of the topic (the whole paragraph except for
the last sentence) and a thesis statement (the last sentence). Also,
the thesis statement identifies the main thing I will do in the paper.
Moreover, the discussion of the topic is accurate, reflecting a good
understanding of relevant readings (in this case Descartes' Synopsis
and his first three Meditations). And although it is not vital to do
so, this
introduction gives context, showing how the particular topic of this
paper (Descartes' argument for God) is related to Descartes' general
project in the Meditations: it explains that his argument for God's
existence is a step towards establishing a firm foundation for all
knowledge. That's not a bad thing to do.</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">So the first
draft
is not horrible. But it&#8217;s not very good, either. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What needs
improvement? </span>Although the discussion of the topic is thorough,
the
thesis statement does not do enough. It articulates the main point I
will make in the paper&#8212;that Descartes&#8217; argument is unsound&#8212;but doesn&#8217;t
say anything about <span style="font-style: italic;">how </span>I
will support this point; there is no road map. Also, the first draft
is too long for such a short paper. Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to (a)
provide a more succinct discussion of the topic and (b) give a more
detailed thesis? Sure, even though it may mean sacrificing some of the
other nice things about the first draft.</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <font style="font-weight: bold;" size="-1"><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;">Here is my
second
draft:</span></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;">Descartes finds
powerful reasons to doubt his beliefs. He hopes that, by overcoming all
of these doubts, he will establish a firm foundation for knowledge
(Descartes 145, 150). The most comprehensive of these doubts is what
later
scholars have dubbed &#8220;defective nature doubt.&#8221; This doubt has two
parts: on one hand, (a) if God exists and is able to do anything, then
it is possible for God to trick Descartes into believing something is
true when it is not. On the other hand, (b) if God does not exist, then
Descartes&#8217; creator was imperfect and perhaps Descartes is then
naturally prone to be mistaken (149). However unlikely these may be,
even the slightest possibility of them suffices to cast doubt on all of
his beliefs. To dispel defective nature doubt, then, Descartes decides
he must establish both that God exists and that God is not a deceiver
(154-5). For if God exists, then Descartes&#8217; creator is not imperfect;
and if God is no deceiver, then God would not trick him. Descartes
gives several arguments for God&#8217;s existence in the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Meditations</span>. In this
paper I will focus on the first argument in the Third Meditation
(156-8). I will argue that it is unsound. After a brief exposition of
Descartes&#8217; argument, I will show that we have reason to doubt two of
its premises and that the argument is invalid because it is circular.</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
      </div>
      <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Overall this
is a
bit shorter, the discussion of the topic is more concise, and the
thesis is more detailed. This draft, then, is a better introduction
because it does a better job at what an intro needs to do.</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">But there is
still
room for improvement. It is still longer than it needs to be. That is
because it discusses material that is not actually relevant to the
assignment. Notice that the assignment is to critique Descartes&#8217;
argument that God <span style="font-style: italic;">exists</span>. The
second draft explains not only why
Descartes needs to show that God exists, but also why he needs to show
that God <span style="font-style: italic;">is no deceiver</span>. The
assignment does not call for that, so we
can cut some of that out, focusing more on the issue of God&#8217;s existence.</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <font style="font-weight: bold;" size="-1"><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;">Here is my
third
draft:</span></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;">Descartes
hopes
that by overcoming all reasons for doubt he will establish a firm
foundation for knowledge (Descartes 145-150). His most comprehensive
doubt, which
has come to be called &#8220;defective nature doubt,&#8221; has two parts: on one
hand, (a) if God exists and is able to do anything, then it is possible
for God to trick Descartes into believing something is true when it is
not. On the other hand, (b) if God does not exist, then Descartes&#8217;
creator was imperfect and perhaps Descartes is then naturally prone to
be mistaken (149). To overcome defective nature doubt, then, Descartes
needs two arguments: that God exists (to dispel b) and that God is no
deceiver (to dispel a)(154-5). In this paper I will criticize the first
of his arguments that God exists, arguing that his first cosmological
argument in M3 (156-8) is unsound. After a brief exposition of
Descartes&#8217; argument, I will show that we have reason to doubt two of
its premises and that the argument is invalid because it is circular.</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
      </div>
      <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">This is fine,
though it could be still shorter; we could take out some more of the
background material.
Still, it does the job of an introduction and takes up no more than
half a page of our three-page paper.</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">There are
other
ways to write a succinct introduction for this paper. For example, if I
am short of space for the rest of the paper I might cut most of the
background
information out and focus even more narrowly on the topic given in the
prompt, like this:</span></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;">In the Third
Meditation, Descartes argues that God must exist because there is no
other way to explain why he, Descartes, has the idea of God in his mind
(Descartes 156-8). In this paper I will show that this argument is
unsound.
After a brief exposition of it, I will show that we have reason to
doubt two of its premises and that the argument is invalid because it
is circular.</span></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      </div>
      <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">This is fine.
It is
also about as brief as you can get and still do what an introduction
needs to do.</span></font></td>

introduction promised your reader that you would do certain things. The
body's purpose is to do those things. </span>If your paper is
expository, this
is where you show your reader how to understand some difficult text or

your reader that you are correct. Obviously it should be by far the

I gave you a piece of text and asked you to explain its meaning.</font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"></font></div>
<ul style="font-family: Georgia; margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><font size="-1">First, make
sure you understand the assigned text. You cannot explain
what you do not know. Get help if you need it, and soon.</font></li>
  <li><font size="-1">Identify
which parts of the text are hardest to understand. You will

    </font></li>
  <li><font size="-1">If there is
some
background knowledge needed to understand the text, provide it.</font></li>
  <li><font size="-1">Try restating
the text in different words--simpler words. Do this
several times, discovering different ways to restate it.</font></li>
  <li><font size="-1">Think of ways
to illustrate what the text says. Can you give a
real-life example? Can you make an analogy? Can you compare what the
text says to something that will be familiar to your reader?<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="-1">If the text
is open to multiple interpretations, consider saying so.
You might mention some of them, and then briefly argue for which
interpretation you think is best. Consider which interpretation best
fits not only the given text but also everything else the author says.</font></li>
  <li><font size="-1">You might
find it helpful to explain things in a different order than
the author did.</font></li>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-family: Georgia;"
 size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tips for
argumentative papers. </span></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"></font></div>
<ul style="font-family: Georgia; margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><font size="-1">First, since
the paper is argumentative, you should know some things
about logic and arguments. At least read <a href="101+213_logic.html">this</a>.</font></li>
  <li><font size="-1">Second,
follow the <a href="101+213_writingtips.html#1b">steps given above on
how to get started</a>.</font></li>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="-1">In
following those steps (especially 3 and 4), review all the
information you have: the text, your notes, any class discussion of the
argument you will critique, etc. Carefully think about the argument and
everything that was said about it. What things were said in support of
it? What criticisms were offered? What considerations for and against
it can you think of? If this is a research paper, do your research:
what have others said about this argument?</font></li>
    <li><font size="-1">Based on
all of this evidence, decide what evaluation the argument
most deserves. <br>
      </font></li>
    <li><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Be aware
that I do not care what position you argue for; it is the quality of
your argument that matters. </span>You get no
more credit for agreeing with me than for disagreeing. So follow the
best evidence.
Period. <br>
      </font></li>
  </ul>
  <li><font size="-1">For an
argument to be good, its premises must be true, and they must
support the conclusion at least well enough to make it plausible (if
the argument is inductive) or to guarantee that the conclusion is true
(if the argument is deductive). This suggests several possible
strategies you might use to criticize it. What follows is just some
ideas, not an
exhaustive list: <br>
    </font></li>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="-1">Show that
the argument is bad because some key premise (or more than
one) is false, or at least doubtful.&nbsp; <br>
      </font></li>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="-1">Note:
merely showing that a premise is false or doubtful is not enough for a
good
paper. You need to explain persuasively <span
 style="font-style: italic;">why </span>its falsity or doubtfulness
gives good reason to be significantly less confident in the conclusion.
        <br>
        </font></li>
    </ul>
    <li><font size="-1">Show that
even if the premises are true we have reason to doubt the
conclusion. There are many ways to do this.</font></li>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="-1">You might
give a <span style="font-style: italic;">counterargument</span>--that
is, construct an argument
using similar logic but which reaches a conclusion we know is false or
at least dubious, and use that to argue that the argument in the text
may be similarly unreliable. <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font size="-1">You might
argue that the conclusion is <span style="font-style: italic;">in fact
        </span>false, and hence that
there could be no valid argument for it. That may be hard; instead you
might try arguing that the conclusion is <span
 style="font-style: italic;">likely </span>to be false, and hence
that we'd better not believe it. <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font size="-1">If the
argument is deductive you might find a
way to show that even if the premises are all true the conclusion <span
 style="font-style: italic;">might </span>not be true. <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font size="-1">Etc. etc. <br>
        </font></li>
    </ul>
    <li><font size="-1">Of course,
even though most arguments have some flaws, you don't have
to devote yourself to saying an argument is bad. You could show that an
argument is, in fact, good. Often what this involves is showing that
some criticism(s) of the argument do not actually work: that the
argument is better than some critic appreciates. (Note that it needs to
be a good critic. Defending an argument against a stupid criticism
won't get you much credit.) <br>
      </font></li>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="-1">In class,
or in an article you find in your research, someone might
argue that a premise is false and that this makes the argument's
conclusion much less plausible. You might disagree, by saying either
that the premise is not false (or is not nearly as doubtful as the
critic thinks), and/or that even if it is false (or doubtful) that
doesn't make the conclusion so doubtful.&nbsp;<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font size="-1">Again,
some critic might have argued that the argument is invalid.
You might show that the critic fails to show this; perhaps the critic
has misunderstood the argument. Or you might grant that the critic has
a point, but show that the argument can be rescued in some way.&nbsp;<br>
        </font></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-family: Georgia;"
 size="-1">In a longer paper
you might combine a number of these strategies. For example, you might
(a) argue that some key premise in an author's argument is false and
that this badly damages the argument, but that nevertheless (b) there
are good independent reasons for believing the conclusion is true. The
longer your paper is, the more important it is that you anticipate
objections to your arguments and deal with those objections. In a very
short paper (2-3 pages) you may have no space for this, but in a longer
paper it is good to show you have reflected critically on your own
arguments.</font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"></font><font style="font-family: Georgia;" size="-1">These
are
general
strategies; it is up to you to decide how to implement them (or
whatever strategy you employ). Beyond that, I have little specific
advice for the body of your paper except this "commandment" from <a

THOU
SHALT
PLAN.
At
some point in the process of writing, list the points
you want to make in favor of your thesis. Each paragraph should make
one of these points. At the end of your paper, you should have a
collection of paragraphs making a set of points that, taken together,
support your thesis.<br>
</font></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"></font><font style="font-family: Georgia;" size="-1">In
other words,
develop an outline of your paper, consisting of the main points you
will make in support of your thesis. Do this even for a short paper.
The outline should make an
argument for your thesis: a series of premises, in a logical order,
which should lead a rational reader to believe your thesis is true.
Then, for each premise, write a paragraph explaining and arguing for
it. That series of paragraphs then makes the body of your paper. (And
those premises then make a thorough thesis statement for your
introduction.)</font><br>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><font size="-1"><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;">Let's suppose I gave you the
assignment
discussed <a href="#4b">above</a>:&nbsp; write a paper evaluating
Descartes&#8217; first
argument for God's existence in his <span style="font-style: italic;">Meditations
on
First
Philosophy</span>.
Your task, then, is to argue either that his argument is good (that is,
sound, plausible) or bad (unsound, implausible). <br>
      <br>
For the examples below, it will be helpful for you to know that
Descartes essentially argues as
follows:</span></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;">a. He has an idea
of God, that is, an idea portraying an infinite, perfect being.</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">b. So this
idea is,
in a way, infinite.</span></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">c. Because
this
idea is
infinite, it could not have been created by a finite being such as
Descartes himself.</span></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">d. So, only
an
infinite being--namely, God--could have created this idea.</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">e. Therefore,
God
must exist.</span></font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      </div>
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">There are
more
details in the argument that I would expect you to know if you were
writing a paper about it, but this summary will do for our purposes
here.<br>
      <br>
To show the argument is bad, you might...<br>
      </span></font>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Cast
doubt on a premise. </span></font><font style="font-family: Georgia;"
 size="-1">A sample thesis might be, "I will
argue that Descartes' argument fails because a finite human mind can,
in fact, construct an infinite idea of God." The thesis here is that
premise (c) above is false. This is a significant premise, because
without it Descartes cannot establish (d) or (e) and his argument
fails. You might, alternatively, argue that he doesn't really have an
idea of God, or that his idea cannot portray an infinite
being--effectively denying premise (a). Consider all the premises of
the argument and ask yourself whether they are true. <br>
          </font></li>
        <li style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">Show
that
even if the premises are true we have reason to doubt the
conclusion...<br>
          </font></li>
        <ul>
          <li style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">By
counterargument. For example, you might try to show that "If we follow
the logic of Descartes' argument we can "prove" the existence of any
number of beings, even those we are confident do not actually exist.
This shows that Descartes' reasoning is faulty. <br>
            </font></li>
          <li style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">By
showing the conclusion is false: "The notion of a supremely perfect
being, such as Descartes' God, is logically incoherent and therefore
cannot exist. So Descartes' argument for this God cannot be sound." <br>
            </font></li>
          <li style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">By
showing the conclusion is, if not false, at least doubtful: "Although
it is logically possible that God exists as Descartes describes, the
amount of evil, suffering, and defect in the world make it hard to
believe."&nbsp; Or: </font><font size="-1">"Descartes argues that God
must exist because
there is no other way to explain why his idea of God is infinite. I
will show, using Descartes' own premises, that even if he did not
create it, such an idea <span style="font-style: italic;">need not </span>have
been
created
by
God." This would show that
Descartes' inference
from (c) to (d) is invalid.&nbsp; </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;">Etc.
etc. </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Georgia;">Be
aware that not all strategies
will work against a given argument.</span><span
 style="font-family: Georgia;"> So think about different
ways you might critcize an argument, and settle on the best one: the
one you believe makes the most persuasive case about the argument. </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Georgia;">Also, be open to the
idea that you have
chosen the wrong side. </span>When you write for me, the "right" side
is the one you can make the best case for. If you find yourself having
trouble showing that an argument is unsound, you might well decide that
instead of criticizing it you should defend it. <br>
            </span></font></li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">To show the
argument is good, you might... <br>
      </span></font>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Consider
an
objection
to
some premise and show that the objection fails. For
example, "Against Descartes it might be objected that he simply made up
his idea of God or was taught it in church and that, therefore, we need
not suppose God made it. However, I will show that nothing short of an
infinite being could have created this idea." <br>
            </span></font></li>
          <li><font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Take
some attempt to show the argument is invalid, and argue that the
attempt fails. For example, "It has been objected that if Descartes'
argument is valid, we could 'prove' that unicorns or other mythical
creatures exist. However, I will show that this is not the case." <br>
            </span></font></li>
          <li><font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Again,
think
about
different
strategies and choose the best one(s) to use in
your paper, and remain open to the possibility that you have chosen the
wrong side.&nbsp; <br>

your topic has
been around (&#8220;Since the beginning of time, humankind has wondered...&#8221;
or any such). Don't begin with a famous quote or give a dictionary
definition. Don't open with a heartstring-tugging or exciting anecdote
to catch your reader&#8217;s attention. All of these waste space and your
reader's attention span.</span></font></li>
  <li><font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">However tempted you may find yourself, no
matter the heights of brilliant poetic eloquence you are capable of, do
not employ excessively lengthy words,
nor a gratuitously great number of them, in hopes of conveying to your
reader the
impression that you are highly intelligent and witty, or for any other
reason. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Translation:
Do not
use big
words to sound smart, nor use more than you need. Fewer, simpler words,
used well, work better. (See what I mean?)</span></span></font></li>

first draft, no matter
how great a writer you are. </span>Complete
the paper and then let it sit for at least a few hours. Then come
back and revise the whole thing to make it even clearer and more
complete. Then repeat that process. Of course this means it is a
bad idea to start the paper the day before it is due.</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Georgia;" size="-1"></font><br>
<font style="font-family: Georgia;" size="-1">For some reason,
philosophical papers generally use the present tense
even when talking about people from long ago. We'll say, "Descartes
says..." or "Chuang-tzu argues that..." even though those folks are
long dead. This is not required; but whatever tense you use, be
consistent about it.</font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">

 name="8"></a>8. Using sources</font><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br>
<span style="font-family: Georgia;">The first and most important rule
about using sources is to cite them whenever you use them. For example,
look at the </span><a style="font-family: Georgia;" href="#4c">sample
introductions above</a><span style="font-family: Georgia;">: every time
I made a claim about what a source said, I cited it. </span><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
<br style="font-family: Georgia;">
If you use any sources outside of assigned texts, y</span></font><font
 style="font-family: Georgia;" size="-1">ou
must be judicious about them. </font><font
 style="font-family: Georgia;" size="-1">This
means three things:</font>
<ol style="font-family: Georgia;">
  <li><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">First, don't
limit
yourself to just one </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">kind </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">of
source. </span><br>
    </font> </li>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="-1">For example, some students simply do a
search on JSTOR and use any relevant-sounding articles near the top of
the search results. That is not the worst way to go, but it is lazy and
is unlikely to find you
the really good stuff. You should also search the Library
catalog for relevant books, search other article databases (EBSCO, the
Philosopher's Index), consult a reference librarian, etc.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <li><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second, be
careful about the </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">quality </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">of your
sources. </span><br>
    </font> </li>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="-1">Peer-reviewed articles and books by
professionals in relevant fields are <span style="font-weight: bold;">best</span>.
This
does
not
mean they are necessarily <span style="font-style: italic;">correct</span>,
but
they
are generally the
best sort of material you can get; they are often the most thoughtful,
sophisticated, and well informed.<br>
      </font> </li>
    <li><font size="-1">Among the <span style="font-weight: bold;">worst



      </span>are those of unknown
origin, those with obvious bias, or by people with unknown
qualifications. Reliance on these can seriously hurt your paper. <br>
      </font></li>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="-1">The internet is rife with this stuff. Many
web sites fail to tell you who wrote them, so you cannot assess the
authors' qualifications. Many others present information as if it were
objective or scientific when actually it is biased towards a particular
point of view. Others may present information that is plagiarized,
perhaps from multiple sources of unknown quality. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Note that Wikipedia articles often contain
some or all of these faults! </span>So do blogs, sites sponsored by
advocacy groups (e.g., a site on stem cell research sponsored by a
Catholic organization), think tanks, and so on. This does not mean
there is no good information to be had from these sources, but you must
be extra cautious.<br>
        </font> </li>
    </ul>
    <li><font size="-1">In the middle are encyclopedias such as
the
Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the Routledge Encyclopedia of
Philosophy, Encyclopedia Britannica, etc. These are
nice places to <span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Georgia;">start



      </span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">your
research--even Wikipedia can be a good place to start, especially when
it gives you leads to other and better sources--but they had better not
be where it ends. In other words, encyclopedia-type
sources may be used to orient yourself to your subject and to find
leads to other
and better sources of information, but much reliance on such sources
in the paper you turn in will count against it. </span></font></li>
  </ul>
  <li style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Third, you may cite lecture/discussion </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">only </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">for material that is not in
any text. </span>For anything that is in a text (i.e., any time you
make a
claim about what an author says), you must cite the text.<br>
    </font></li>

 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">doomed</span></font><br
 style="font-family: Georgia;">
<font size="-1"><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Academic integrity has a number of
different forms: not disrupting class, not cheating on tests, etc. But <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">for writing papers, the key to academic
integrity is this: never, <span style="font-style: italic;">ever </span>make
someone
else's
work
appear as if it were yours, even by accident. </span><br>
<br>
</span></font><font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">The
first and most
important rule for maintaining academic integrity, then, is the same as
the first rule for using sources: cite them whenever you use them.
Specifically: if you use an idea you got from somewhere besides
yourself, cite it.
If you express that idea using someone else's words or a close
paraphrase, put it in quotation marks and cite it.<br>
<br>

Academic
Integrity
policy</a> applies to all my paper assignments (and, indeed, to the
entire course). For any claim
that is not common knowledge or your own idea,
I require that you cite any and
all of
the sources you rely on. This includes ideas gleaned from assigned
texts, reading
responses,
class discussion, your roommate, somebody's blog, the news, your mom, <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-family: Georgia;">everything</span><span

or
express the idea using your own words. </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-family: Georgia;">Every </span><span

often do check sources. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia;"></span></font><font
 style="font-family: Georgia;" size="-1">Specifically, your list of

 style="font-family: Georgia;"><br>
<br>
In this guide, I have given a number of recommendations and
requirements. It seems only fair, then, that your papers be graded
based on how well you follow the recommendations and meet the
requirements. To summarize them (and thereby provide a conclusion to
this guide), here are the questions you should ask yourself about your
work before you turn it in. It is also the list of questions I will ask
when I read it, and the answers will determine the paper's grade. <br>
<br>
</span></font><font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">About
the paper as a whole:<br>
</span></font><font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">How
well does it demonstrate that you understand what you're talking about?<br>
How well does it demonstrate that you've been thinking about the
material?<br>
How well do you clarify the material (when called for) and argue for
your side (when called for?)<br>
About the parts of the paper:<br>
</span></font><font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Does
the paper have at least an introduction and a body? If it is more than
three pages, does it also have a conclusion?<br>
Does the introduction do its job? I.e., does it succinctly provide a
discussion of your topic and a thesis statement, including a road map
to your paper?<br>
About the body of the paper:<br>
How well organized is it?<br>
How well does it explain the material where necessary?<br>
How well does it make a case for your side, when called for?<br>
Are your arguments cogent? Logical? Fair? Clear?<br>
Does it match what the introduction promised?<br>
</span></font><font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">About
the formatting and style:<br>
Is the formatting correct?<br>
Is the writing clear, and not overcomplicated?<br>
About the use of sources (if called for):<br>
<br>
About academic integrity: <br>
If sources are used, are they all properly cited?<br>
Do the sources contain all the information I need to track them down?<br>
<br>
<br>
</span></font><font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Is it
well organized? <br>
Does it <br>
<br>
Intro: succinct? contains 2 elements; matches body; body: organized,
logical, presents best arguments, to the point, originality; conclusion
if any; formatting; style; quality of research; integrity<br>
