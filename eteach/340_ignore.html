                    As a corollary to the proposition that all
                    institutions must be subordinated to the law of
                    equal freedom, we cannot choose but admit the right
                    of the citizen to adopt a condition of voluntary
                    outlawry.[<a name="ref1"></a><a href="#note1">1</a>]
                    If every man has freedom to do all that he wills,
                    provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any
                    other man, then he is free to drop connection with
                    the state -- to relinquish its protection and to
                    refuse paying toward its support. It is self-evident
                    that in so behaving he in no way trenches upon the
                    liberty of others, for his position is a passive
                    one, and while passive he cannot become an
                    aggressor. It is equally self-evident that he cannot
                    be compelled to continue one of a political
                    corporation without a breach of the moral law,
                    seeing that citizenship involves payment of taxes;
                    and the taking away of a man's property against his
                    will is an infringement of his rights. Government
                    being simply an agent employed in common by a number
                    of individuals to secure to them certain advantages,
                    the very nature of the connection implies that it is
                    for each to say whether he will employ such an agent
                    or not. If anyone of them determines to ignore this
                    mutual-safety confederation, nothing can be said
                    except that he loses all claim to its good offices
                    and exposes himself to the danger of maltreatment --
                    a thing he is quite at liberty to do if he likes. He
                    cannot be coerced into political combination without
                    a breach of the law of equal freedom; he can
                    withdraw from it without committing any such breach,
                    and he has therefore a right so to withdraw. </span></font></span><font

                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">2. "No human laws
                  are of any validity if contrary to the law of nature;
                  and such of them as are valid derive all their force
                  and all their authority mediately or immediately from
                  this original." Thus writes Blackstone, to whom let
                  all honor be given for having so far outseen the ideas
                  of his time and, indeed, we may say of our time. A
                  good antidote, this, for those political superstitions
                  which so widely prevail. A good check upon that
                  sentiment of power worship which still misleads us by
                  magnifying the prerogatives of constitutional
                  governments as it once did those of monarchs. Let men
                  learn that a legislature is not "our God upon earth,"
                  though, by the authority they ascribe to it and the
                  things they expect from it, they would seem to think
                  it is. Let them learn rather that it is an institution
                  serving a purely temporary purpose, whose power, when
                  not stolen, is at best borrowed. </span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">Nay, indeed, have we
                  not seen that government is essentially immoral? Is it
                  not the offspring of evil, bearing about it all the
                  marks of its parentage? Does it not exist because
                  crime exists? Is it not strong -- or, as we say,
                  despotic -- when crime is great? Is there not more
                  liberty -- that is, less government -- when crime
                  diminishes? And must not government cease when crime
                  ceases, for very lack of objects on which to perform
                  its function? Not only does magisterial power exist
                  because of evil, but it exists by evil. Violence is
                  employed to maintain it, and all violence involves
                  criminality. Soldiers, policemen, and jailers; swords,
                  batons, and fetters are instruments for inflicting
                  pain; and all infliction of pain is in the abstract
                  wrong. The state employs evil weapons to subjugate
                  evil and is alike contaminated by the objects with
                  which it deals and the means by which it works.
                  Morality cannot recognize it, for morality, being
                  simply a statement of the perfect law, can give no
                  countenance to anything growing out of, and living by,
                  breaches of that law. Wherefore, legislative authority
                  can never be ethical -- must always be conventional
                  merely. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">Hence, there is a
                  certain inconsistency in the attempt to determine the
                  right position, structure, and conduct of a government
                  by appeal to the first principles of rectitude. For as
                  just pointed out, the acts of an institution which is
                  in both nature and origin imperfect cannot be made to
                  square with the perfect law. All that we can do is to
                  ascertain, firstly, in what attitude a legislature
                  must stand to the community to avoid being by its mere
                  existence an embodied wrong; secondly, in what manner
                  it must be constituted so as to exhibit the least
                  incongruity with the moral law; and thirdly, to what
                  sphere its actions must be limited to prevent it from
                  multiplying those breaches of equity it is set up to
                  prevent. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">The first condition
                  to be conformed to before a legislature can be
                  established without violating the law of equal freedom
                  is the acknowledgment of the right now under
                  discussion -- the right to ignore the state. </span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">3. Upholders of pure
                  despotism may fitly believe state control to be
                  unlimited and unconditional. They who assert that men
                  are made for governments and not governments for men
                  may consistently hold that no one can remove himself
                  beyond the pale of political organization. But they
                  who maintain that the people are the only legitimate
                  source of power -- that legislative authority is not
                  original, but deputed -- cannot deny the right to
                  ignore the state without entangling themselves in an
                  absurdity. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">For, if legislative
                  authority is deputed, it follows that those from whom
                  it proceeds are the masters of those on whom it is
                  conferred; it follows further that as masters they
                  confer the said authority voluntarily; and this
                  implies that they may give or withhold it as they
                  please. To call that deputed which is wrenched from
                  men, whether they will or not, is nonsense. But what
                  is here true of all collectively is equally true of
                  each separately. As a government can rightly act for
                  the people only when empowered by them, so also can it
                  rightly act for the individual only when empowered by
                  him. If A, B, and C debate whether they shall employ
                  an agent to perform for them a certain service, and if
                  while A and B agree to do so C dissents, C cannot
                  equitably be made a party to the agreement in spite of
                  himself. And this must be equally true of thirty as of
                  three; and if of thirty, why not of three hundred, or
                  three thousand, or three million? </span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">4. Of the political
                  superstitions lately alluded to, none is so
                  universally diffused as the notion that majorities are
                  omnipotent. Under the impression that the preservation
                  of order will ever require power to be wielded by some
                  party, the moral sense of our time feels that such
                  power cannot rightly be conferred on any but the
                  largest moiety of society. It interprets literally the
                  saying that "the voice of the people is the voice of
                  God," and, transferring to the one the sacredness
                  attached to the other, it concludes that from the will
                  of the people -- that is, of the majority -- there can
                  be no appeal. Yet is this belief entirely erroneous. </span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">Suppose, for the
                  sake of argument, that, struck by some Malthusian
                  panic, a legislature duly representing public opinion
                  were to enact that all children born during the next
                  ten years should be drowned. Does anyone think such an
                  enactment would be warrantable? If not, there is
                  evidently a limit to the power of a majority. Suppose,
                  again, that of two races living together -- Celts and
                  Saxons, for example -- the most numerous determined to
                  make the others their slaves. Would the authority of
                  the greatest number be in such case valid? If not,
                  there is something to which its authority must be
                  subordinate. Suppose, once more, that all men having
                  incomes under &pound; 50 a year were to resolve upon
                  reducing every income above that amount to their own
                  standard, and appropriating the excess for public
                  purposes. Could their resolution be justified? If not,
                  it must be a third time confessed that there is a law
                  to which the popular voice must defer. What, then, is
                  that law, if not the law of pure equity -- the law of
                  equal freedom? These restraints, which all would put
                  to the will of the majority, are exactly the
                  restraints set up by that law. We deny the right of a
                  majority to murder, to enslave, or to rob, simply
                  because murder, enslaving, and robbery are violations
                  of that law -- violations too gross to be overlooked.
                  But if great violations of it are wrong, so also are
                  smaller ones. If the will of the many cannot supersede
                  the first principle of morality in these cases,
                  neither can it in any. So that, however insignificant
                  the minority, and however trifling the proposed
                  trespass against their rights, no such trespass is
                  permissible. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">When we have made
                  our constitution purely democratic, thinks to himself
                  the earnest reformer, we shall have brought government
                  into harmony with absolute justice. Such a faith,
                  though perhaps needful for the age, is a very
                  erroneous one. By no process can coercion be made
                  equitable. The freest form of government is only the
                  least objectionable form. The rule of the many by the
                  few we call tyranny; the rule of the few by the many
                  is tyranny also, only of a less intense kind. "You
                  shall do as we will, and not as you will," is in
                  either case the declaration; and if the hundred make
                  it to the ninety-nine, instead of the ninety-nine to
                  the hundred, it is only a fraction less immoral. Of
                  two such parties, whichever fulfills this declaration
                  necessarily breaks the law of equal freedom: the only
                  difference being that by the one it is broken in the
                  persons of ninety-nine, while by the other it is
                  broken in the persons of a hundred. And the merit of
                  the democratic form of government consists solely in
                  this, that it trespasses against the smallest number.
                </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">The very existence
                  of majorities and minorities is indicative of an
                  immoral state. The man whose character harmonizes with
                  the moral law, we found to be one who can obtain
                  complete happiness without diminishing the happiness
                  of his fellows. But the enactment of public
                  arrangements by vote implies a society consisting of
                  men otherwise constituted -- implies that the desires
                  of some cannot be satisfied without sacrificing the
                  desires of others -- implies in the pursuit of their
                  happiness the majority inflict a certain amount of
                  unhappiness on the minority -- implies, therefore,
                  organic immorality. Thus, from another point of view,
                  we again perceive that even in its most equitable form
                  it is impossible for government to dissociate itself
                  from evil; and further, that unless the right to
                  ignore the state is recognized, its acts must be
                  essentially criminal. </span><br style="font-family:

                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">5. That a man is
                  free to abandon the benefits and throw off the burdens
                  of citizenship may indeed be inferred from the
                  admissions of existing authorities and of current
                  opinion. Unprepared as they probably are for so
                  extreme a doctrine as the one here maintained, the
                  radicals of our day yet unwittingly profess their
                  belief in a maxim which obviously embodies this
                  doctrine. Do we not continually hear them quote
                  Blackstone's assertion that "no subject of England can
                  be constrained to pay any aids or taxes even for the
                  defence of the realm or the support of government, but
                  such as are imposed by his own consent, or that of his
                  representative in parliament?" And what does this
                  mean? It means, say they, that every man should have a
                  vote. True, but it means much more. If there is any
                  sense in words it is a distinct enunciation of the
                  right now contended for. In affirming that a man may
                  not be taxed unless he has directly or indirectly
                  given his consent, it affirms that he may refuse to be
                  so taxed; and to refuse to be taxed is to cut all
                  connection with the state. Perhaps it will be said
                  that this consent is not a specific, but a general
                  one, and that the citizen is understood to have
                  assented to everything his representative may do when
                  he voted for him. But suppose he did not vote for him,
                  and on the contrary did all in his power to get
                  elected someone holding opposite views -- what then?
                  The reply will probably be that, by taking part in
                  such an election, he tacitly agreed to abide by the
                  decision of the majority. And how if he did not vote
                  at all? Why, then he cannot justly complain of any
                  tax, seeing that he made no protest against its
                  imposition. So, curiously enough, it seems that he
                  gave his consent in whatever way he acted -- whether
                  he said yes, whether he said no, or whether he
                  remained neuter! A rather awkward doctrine, this. Here
                  stands an unfortunate citizen who is asked if he will
                  pay money for a certain proffered advantage; and
                  whether he employs the only means of expressing his
                  refusal or does not employ it, we are told that he
                  practically agrees, if only the number of others who
                  agree is greater than the number of those who dissent.
                  And thus we are introduced to the novel principle that
                  A's consent to a thing is not determined by what A
                  says, but by what B may happen to say! </span><br

                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">It is for those who
                  quote Blackstone to choose between this absurdity and
                  the doctrine above set forth. Either his maxim implies
                  the right to ignore the state, or it is sheer
                  nonsense. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">

                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">6. There is a
                  strange heterogeneity in our political faiths. Systems
                  that have had their day and are beginning here and
                  there to let the daylight through are patched with
                  modern notions utterly unlike in quality and color;
                  and men gravely display these systems, wear them, and
                  walk about in them, quite unconscious of their
                  grotesqueness. This transition state of ours,
                  partaking as it does equally of the past and the
                  future, breeds hybrid theories exhibiting the oddest
                  union of bygone despotism and coming freedom. Here are
                  types of the old organization curiously disguised by
                  germs of the new, peculiarities showing adaptation to
                  a preceding state modified by rudiments that prophesy
                  of something to come, making altogether so chaotic a
                  mixture of relationships that there is no saying to
                  what class these births of the age should be referred.
                </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">As ideas must of
                  necessity bear the stamp of the time, it is useless to
                  lament the contentment with which these incongruous
                  beliefs are held. Otherwise it would seem unfortunate
                  that men do not pursue to the end the trains of
                  reasoning which have led to these partial
                  modifications. In the present case for example,
                  consistency would force them to admit that, on other
                  points besides the one just noticed, they hold
                  opinions and use arguments in which the right to
                  ignore the state is involved. </span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">For what is the
                  meaning of Dissent? The time was when a man's faith
                  and his mode of worship were as much determinable by
                  law as his secular acts; and, according to provisions
                  extant in our statute book, are so still. Thanks to
                  the growth of a Protestant spirit, however, we have
                  ignored the state in this matter -- wholly in theory,
                  and partly in practice. But how have we done so? By
                  assuming an attitude which, if consistently
                  maintained, implies a right to ignore the state
                  entirely. Observe the positions of the two parties.
                  "This is your creed," says the legislator; "you must
                  believe and openly profess what is here set down for
                  you." "I shall not do anything of the kind," answers
                  the nonconformist; "I will go to prison rather." "Your
                  religious ordinances," pursues the legislator, "shall
                  be such as we have prescribed. You shall attend the
                  churches we have endowed and adopt the ceremonies used
                  in them." "Nothing shall induce me to do so," is the
                  reply; "I altogether deny your power to dictate to me
                  in such matters, and mean to resist to the uttermost."
                  "Lastly," adds the legislator, "we shall require you
                  to pay such sums of money toward the support of these
                  religious institutions as we may see fit to ask." "Not
                  a farthing will you have from me," exclaims our sturdy
                  Independent; "even did I believe in the doctrines of
                  your church (which I do not), I should still rebel
                  against your interference; and if you take my
                  property, it shall be by force and under protest." </span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">What now does this
                  proceeding amount to when regarded in the abstract? It
                  amounts to an assertion by the individual of the right
                  to exercise one of his faculties -- the religious
                  sentiment -- without let or hindrance, and with no
                  limit save that set up by the equal claims of others.
                  And what is meant by ignoring the state? Simply an
                  assertion of the right similarly to exercise all the
                  faculties. The one is just an expansion of the other
                  -- rests on the same footing with the other -- must
                  stand or fall with the other. Men do indeed speak of
                  civil and religious liberty as different things: but
                  the distinction is quite arbitrary. They are parts of
                  the same whole and cannot philosophically be
                  separated. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">"Yes they can,"
                  interposes the objector; "assertion of the one is
                  imperative as being a religious duty. The liberty to
                  worship God in the way that seems to him right is a
                  liberty without which a man cannot fulfill what he
                  believes to be Divine commands, and therefore
                  conscience requires him to maintain it." True enough;
                  but how if the same can be asserted of all other
                  liberty? How if maintenance of this also turns out to
                  be a matter of conscience? Have we not seen that human
                  happiness is the Divine will -- that only by
                  exercising our faculties is this happiness obtainable
                  -- and that it is impossible to exercise them without
                  freedom? And if this freedom for the exercise of
                  faculties is a condition without which the Divine will
                  cannot be fulfilled, the preservation of it is, by our
                  objector's own showing, a duty. Or, in other words, it
                  appears not only that the maintenance of liberty of
                  action may be a point of conscience, but that it ought
                  to be one. And thus we are clearly shown that the
                  claims to ignore the state in religious and in secular
                  matters are in essence identical. </span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">The other reason
                  commonly assigned for nonconformity admits of similar
                  treatment. Besides resisting state dictation in the
                  abstract, the dissenter resists it from disapprobation
                  of the doctrines taught. No legislative injunction
                  will make him adopt what he considers an erroneous
                  belief; and, bearing in mind his duty toward his
                  fellow men, he refuses to help through the medium of
                  his purse in disseminating this erroneous belief. The
                  position is perfectly intelligible. But it is one
                  which either commits its adherents to civil
                  nonconformity also, or leaves them in a dilemma. For
                  why do they refuse to be instrumental in spreading
                  error? Because error is adverse to human happiness.
                  And on what ground is any piece of secular legislation
                  disapproved? For the same reason -- because thought
                  adverse to human happiness. How, then, can it be shown
                  that the state ought to be resisted in the one case
                  and not in the other? Will anyone deliberately assert
                  that if a government demands money from us to aid in
                  teaching what we think will produce evil we ought to
                  refuse it, but that if the money is for the purpose of
                  doing what we think will produce evil we ought not to
                  refuse it? Yet such is the hopeful proposition which
                  those have to maintain who recognize the right to
                  ignore the state in religious matters but deny it in
                  civil matters. </span><br style="font-family:

                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">7. The substance of
                  this chapter once more reminds us of the incongruity
                  between a perfect law and an imperfect state. The
                  impracticability of the principle here laid down
                  varies directly as social morality. In a thoroughly
                  vicious community its admission would be productive of
                  anarchy. In a completely virtuous one its admission
                  will be both innocuous and inevitable. Progress toward
                  a condition of social health -- a condition, that is,
                  in which the remedial measures of legislation will no
                  longer be needed -- is progress toward a condition in
                  which those remedial measures will be cast aside and
                  the authority prescribing them disregarded. The two
                  changes are of necessity co-ordinate. That moral sense
                  whose supremacy will make society harmonious and
                  government unnecessary is the same moral sense which
                  will then make each man assert his freedom even to the
                  extent of ignoring the state -- is the same moral
                  sense which, by deterring the majority from coercing
                  the minority, will eventually render government
                  impossible. And as what are merely different
                  manifestations of the same sentiment must bear a
                  constant ratio to each other, the tendency to
                  repudiate governments will increase only at the same
                  rate that governments become needless. </span><br

                  alarmed, therefore, at the promulgation of the
                  foregoing doctrine. There are many changes yet to be
                  passed through before it can begin to exercise much
                  influence. Probably a long time will elapse before the
                  right to ignore the state will be generally admitted,
                  even in theory. It will be still longer before it
                  receives legislative recognition. And even then there
                  will be plenty of checks upon the premature exercise
                  of it. A sharp experience will sufficiently instruct
                  those who may too soon abandon legal protection.
                  While, in the majority of men, there is such a love of
                  tried arrangements and so great a dread of experiments
                  that they will probably not act upon this right until
                  long after it is safe to do so. </span></font> <br>

                <a name="note1"></a><a href="#ref1">1. </a>Today we
                tend to equate "outlaw" with "criminal." Spencer's
                meaning is more literal. To be an outlaw is simply to be
                outside the protection of the law, i.e., no longer a
                member of society. Being an outlaw in this sense means
                you cannot claim any benefit of society; so, for
                example, if someone attacks you, you are not entitled to
                police protection. It would also, according to Spencer,
                mean you do not owe society any support or obedience. <br>
