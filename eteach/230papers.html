                    false</a>. Feel free to experiment with AI's if you
                  like, but for work you turn in for credit I recommend
                  you only use material from an AI when you can verify
                  it is accurate, or as an example you critically
                  evaluate. (Which, in practice, may mean that you don't
                  use it in this course at all.)</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The more you let AI
                    do for you, the more you undermine your own
                    education.</span> Developing and practicing skills
                  in reading, critical thinking, and writing are among
                  the most important benefits of a liberal arts
                  education. Those skills matter at least as much as
                  whatever facts you learn because they are fundamental
                  to interacting intelligently with the world. Without
                  them, you cannot even assess whether AI is feeding you
                  bullshit. </li>
              </ul>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">The policy: </span>if
              you use any AI in any way you must document how you used
              it by showing your prompts and AI's responses.
              (Screenshots are good for this.) Any use of AI that you
              fail to document is a form of plagiarism and may be
              charged as such.<br>
              <br>
              Here are some possible examples:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>If you copy any text generated by an AI (whether
                  it's just a turn of phrase or something more), put it
                  in quotation marks and cite the AI.</li>
                <li>If you use anything (such as an idea, or an example)
                  you got from an AI without copying the words, still
                  cite the AI.</li>
                <li>If you use an AI to correct your grammar, spelling,
                  punctuation, etc., or to help outline your paper, say
                  so, and cite the AI. </li>
              </ul>
              In short, if you use AI to affect the content of your work
              in any way whatsoever (wording, ideas, examples,
              arguments, grammar, punctuation, organization, etc.),
              document it. And, of course, the more work the AI does,
              the less credit you earn.<br>
              <br>
              I may use a variety of AI detectors to check your work.<br>
              <br>
              This is merely an extension of the plagiarism policy
              above, and reflects the main goal of academic integrity
              generally, which is to give credit for any help you got. <br>
              <br>
              As always, if you are unsure what's OK, ask me, preferably
              before turning work in. <br>
              <br>
              Like the rest of these academic integrity instructions,
              this policy applies to reading responses, drafts, papers,
              and take-home exams (if any). Citing and quoting are not
              required for in-class exams because for them you must
              write solely from memory.<br>

            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">I am not saying this is the
              only way, but this works. If you have different ideas
              about how to do a paper in this course, it would be good
              to <a href="230home.html#contact">meet with me</a> and
              discuss them. <br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">First, give a readers a
                clear preview </span>of what you will do in the paper
              in a brief (no more than half a page) introduction which
              includes a thesis and map. <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Two reasons for including a thesis and map in your
                  intro: first, it's a courtesy to readers. Second,
                  writing it gets you to reflect on, and refine, what
                  you're going to say in the paper. </li>
                <li>Your <span style="font-weight: bold;">thesis </span>is

























                  the overall conclusion that you are going to argue
                  for; the main thing you want to persuade readers of. <br>
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Examples:&nbsp;</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>"Although Thrasymachus' claim that 'injustice is
                      always stronger than justice' is open to some
                      counterexamples, it is nevertheless more plausible
                      than Socrates thinks," or&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>"Benedict exaggerates how deeply our values are
                      'moulded' by culture; Rachels shows how we can
                      identify some universally-valid moral rules."</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
                <li>After the thesis, give a <span style="font-weight:
                    bold;">map</span> -- a short preview of the main
                  steps you will take to argue for your thesis. For
                  example, you could concisely summarize some
                  objection(s) you will consider, and how you intend to
                  rebut it/them (if you intend to).</li>
                <li>Resist the urge to do much more than this in your
                  intro.</li>
              </ul>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Then, explain an author's
                view, using the text, </span>in a page or two.<br>
              <ul>
                <li>Pick something substantial from one of our texts
                  which you want to support or criticize.</li>
                <li>State the <span style="font-style: italic;">strongest

























                  </span>reasons your chosen author provides for it, not
                  all of them. Whether you agree with it or not, present
                  it charitably: what is the most persuasive way the
                  author's view can be stated?</li>
                <li>Do not just write out your notes from class. Go to
                  the text and find the argument there. You may find
                  that it differs from the impression you got in class.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>A good way to do this is
                    quote-explain-quote-explain: to reconstruct an
                    author's view, quote the author and explain what
                    they mean, quote some more, explain some more, and
                    so on.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Give yourself a page or two to do this well.</li>
              </ul>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Then, critically evaluate
                that view.</span><br>
              <ul>
                <li>One way to critically evaluate a view is to
                  challenge it with objections. You could provide
                  objections of your own or borrow from texts, class
                  discussion, or outside research (<a href="#integrity">cite

























                    all sources</a>, of course, and <a
                    href="230presentation.html#research">choose sources
                    wisely</a> if you do research outside course
                  materials). Given the disagreements between our
                  authors, you will often be able to bring up what one
                  author says to rebut another.</li>
                <li>It's more effective to give one or two strong points
                  against the author's view, and state them well, than
                  to raise many brief objections.</li>
                <li>Again, give yourself a page or two to do this well.</li>
              </ul>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">In the end, draw a
                reasonable conclusion </span>from the evidence you're
              provided.<br>
              <ul>
                <li>You may support the author's view or reject it, in
                  whole or in part. But whatever you conclude needs to
                  be clearly supported by the evidence you've given.</li>
                <li>Do not just give your personal opinion. Instead,
                  explain why any reasonable reader should agree with
                  your conclusion, giving clear reasons why. Philosophy
                  is less about personal expression than it is about
                  rational persuasion.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Evaluating the
                    author's view doesn't have to mean showing it is
                    bad. </span>Maybe it turns out the view is good --
                  or at least that some objection(s) fail to show it's
                  bad. There are lots of ways a paper can go. Here are
                  some examples:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Here's something this author says. Here's an
                    objection. Here's why the objection shows the author
                    is wrong. The end.</li>
                  <li>Here's something this author says. Here's an
                    objection. The objection, though, fails to show the
                    author is wrong. So, the author's view is immune to
                    that objection. </li>
                  <li>Here's something this author says. Here's an
                    objection. Here's why this objection fails. But
                    wait, here's another objection, and it succeeds.</li>
                  <li>Here's something this author says. Here's an
                    objection. Oh, and here's another. But here's why
                    they both fail to show the argument is bad.</li>
                  <li>Here's this author's view. Here's why it's partly
                    right, and here's why it's partly wrong. <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>...and so on.</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
