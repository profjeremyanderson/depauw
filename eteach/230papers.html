            Paper assignments will require you to express challenging
            ideas clearly and accurately and critically appraise them
            fairly. Further details will be posted here as the course

                          <br>
                          Plagiarism is presenting another's work as if
                          it were your own. "Another's work" includes
                          anything you didn't make up yourself: the work
                          of other people, material produced by AI, etc.
                          It includes their ideas and the words they
                          used to express their ideas. Therefore, to
                          avoid plagiarizing:</span><br>

                <li>Two reasons for including a thesis and map in your

                <li>Your <span style="font-weight: bold;">thesis </span>is
                  the overall conclusion that you are going to argue
                  for; the main thing you want to persuade readers of. <br>

                <ul>
                  <li>Examples:&nbsp;</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>"Although Thrasymachus' claim that 'injustice is
                      always stronger than justice' is open to some
                      counterexamples, it is nevertheless more plausible
                      than Socrates thinks," or&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>"Benedict exaggerates how deeply our values are

                  steps you will take to argue for your thesis. For
                  example, you could concisely summarize some
                  objection(s) you will consider, and how you intend to
                  rebut it/them (if you intend to).</li>
                <li>Resist the urge to do much more than this in your
                  intro.</li>
              </ul>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Then, explain an author's
                view, using the text, </span>in a page or two.<br>
              <ul>
                <li>Pick something substantial from one of our texts
                  which you want to support or criticize.</li>
                <li>State the <span style="font-style: italic;">strongest
                  </span>reasons your chosen author provides for it, not
                  all of them. Whether you agree with it or not, present
                  it charitably: what is the most persuasive way the
                  author's view can be stated?</li>
                <li>Do not just write out your notes from class. Go to
                  the text and find the argument there. You may find
                  that it differs from the impression you got in class.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>A good way to do this is
                    quote-explain-quote-explain: to reconstruct an
                    author's view, quote the author and explain what
                    they mean, quote some more, explain some more, and
                    so on.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Give yourself a page or two to do this well.</li>
              </ul>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Then, critically evaluate
                that view.</span><br>
              <ul>
                <li>One way to critically evaluate a view is to
                  challenge it with objections. You could provide
                  objections of your own or borrow from texts, class
                  discussion, or outside research (<a href="#integrity">cite
                    all sources</a>, of course, and <a
                    href="230presentation.html#research">choose sources
                    wisely</a> if you do research outside course
                  materials). Given the disagreements between our
                  authors, you will often be able to bring up what one
                  author says to rebut another.</li>
                <li>It's more effective to give one or two strong points
                  against the author's view, and state them well, than
                  to raise many brief objections.</li>
                <li>Again, give yourself a page or two to do this well.</li>
              </ul>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">In the end, draw a
                reasonable conclusion </span>from the evidence you're
              provided.<br>
              <ul>
                <li>You may support the author's view or reject it, in
                  whole or in part. But whatever you conclude needs to
                  be clearly supported by the evidence you've given.</li>
                <li>Do not just give your personal opinion. Instead,
                  explain why any reasonable reader should agree with
                  your conclusion, giving clear reasons why. Philosophy
                  is less about personal expression than it is about
                  rational persuasion.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Evaluating the
                    author's view doesn't have to mean showing it is
                    bad. </span>Maybe it turns out the view is good --
                  or at least that some objection(s) fail to show it's
                  bad. There are lots of ways a paper can go. Here are
                  some examples:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Here's something this author says. Here's an
                    objection. Here's why the objection shows the author
                    is wrong. The end.</li>
                  <li>Here's something this author says. Here's an
                    objection. The objection, though, fails to show the
                    author is wrong. So, the author's view is immune to
                    that objection. </li>
                  <li>Here's something this author says. Here's an
                    objection. Here's why this objection fails. But
                    wait, here's another objection, and it succeeds.</li>
                  <li>Here's something this author says. Here's an
                    objection. Oh, and here's another. But here's why
                    they both fail to show the argument is bad.</li>
                  <li>Here's this author's view. Here's why it's partly
                    right, and here's why it's partly wrong. <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>...and so on.</li>

            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Prompt:</span><br>
            <br>
            Our texts have promoted competing ideas about the basis of
            morality: that there is no basis (and is bad for you)
            (Thrasymachus); that morality's sole basis is culture
            (Benedict); and that morality has some universal, objective
            basis (Rachels, King, and Aquinas). They cannot all be
            right.<br>
            <br>
            So where do you stand? Well, that's too big a question for a
            short paper. So let's make it more specific: write a paper
            in which you take a stand on one of our readings, or (since
            some of them said a whole lot), some significant part of one
            of our readings.<br>
            <br>
            Your paper should be about 1100-1500 words, i.e., 3-5 pages
            long (but don't worry much about length; <a

              here</a>). <br>
            <br>
            Here are some things you might write about. These are just
            suggestions:<br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight:
                bold;">About Thrasymachus</span><br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">He claims that "justice is
                the advantage of the stronger" (Plato, 15), implying
                that morality is just a scam orchestrated by the strong
                against the weak. What are his reasons for this (Plato,
                16-22, especially 21-2)? How compelling are they? <br>
                <br>
                You might consider Thrasymachus's arguments in light of
                some argument for objectivism we've read. Or, you might
                consider whether some objection(s) from Socrates (Plato,
                22-34) raises later in the Plato reading, such as the
                one about the band of robbers (30-1). What conclusions,
                if any, can we draw about Thrasymachus's view on the
                value or nature of justice?<br>
              </div>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">About Benedict</span><br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Benedict argues that
                society shapes most of its members to fit within its
                norms (6). She suggests this "moulding" is so profound
                that when we judge others we can do it only via the
                norms of our society, which vary so radically it is
                doubtful we can have any objective basis for morality
                (5). For a paper on Benedict, you might discuss: To what
                extent, if any, is she right about this? <br>
                <br>
                You might consider Benedict in light of Rachels's
                argument that there is less moral disagreement than it
                seems (Rachels, 5-6), or Rachels's argument that all
                cultures must have some values in common (Rachels, 7),
                or some other argument for moral objectivism from
                Rachels, King, or Aquinas. Who makes the stronger case,
                and why?<br>
              </div>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">About Rachels</span><br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">His article is divided
                into nine sections. You might focus your paper on any
                one of section 3, 5, 6, or 7. For example, is Rachels
                right that there is less disagreement than it seems
                (section 5)? Or, how plausible is his argument that all
                cultures have some rules in common (section 6)? Or, does
                Rachels manage to show that there is a culture-neutral
                standard of right and wrong (section 7)? For any of
                these, you might consider how someone like Thrasymachus
                or Benedict might object to Rachels; who makes the
                stronger case, and why?<br>
              </div>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">About King</span><br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">King argues that we can
                tell just from unjust laws (16-19), and that we should
                obey just laws but disobey unjust laws (15). How good is
                his case for either or both of these? <br>
                <br>
                You might consider whether King refutes Thrasymachus's
                arguments, or Benedict's. (If you're going to write
                about King, be sure to read paragraphs 1-13 as well as
                the assigned part.)<br>
              </div>
              &nbsp;<br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">About Aquinas</span><br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Aquinas argues that there
                are some objective facts about human nature, and that
                some moral rules are objectively justified because they
                fit with our nature. More specifically, he says our
                natural inclinations are the basis for precepts of
                natural law, which in turn are the basis for making and
                evaluating human laws (Aquinas, 4-7). To what extent is
                any of this plausible? In what way(s) is it problematic?
                You might write a paper focusing on some part of
                Aquinas, either defending it from some objection or
                criticizing it. <br>
                <br>
                You might discuss how Thrasymachus challenges Aquinas,
                or discuss how much Benedict's observations about
                culture create a problem for Aquinas.<br>
              </div>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Do you have another idea
                for a paper about these texts? </span><a
