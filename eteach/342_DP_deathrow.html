<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">SAN QUENTIN &#8212;
When prison guards strapped nervous three-time killer Donald Beardslee
to a gurney and administered a lethal injection just after midnight
here Jan. 19, it was the first California execution in more than three
years.<br>
<br>
Beardslee, who in 1981 brutally murdered two young San Francisco-area
women after he was paroled from a Missouri prison on another murder
conviction, waited 21 years for his day of reckoning. He was 61 and had
been on death row longer than the entire life span of one of his
victims.<br>
<br>
In the quarter century since Californians voted overwhelmingly to
restore the death penalty, county prosecutors and juries have put more
condemned murderers on death row in this state than in any other except
Texas.<br>
<br>
Despite the public's willingness to hand out death sentences,
California is one of the more hesitant among the 38 capital punishment
states to use the penalty, causing some to question if the enormous
ongoing cost of capital punishment is worth the relatively few
executions it produces.<br>
<br>
California has 640 inmates on death row, about 20% of the nation's
total. But the state has accounted for only 1% of the nation's
executions &#8212; or 11 deaths &#8212; since 1978, when the death penalty was
restored.<br>
<br>
"What we are paying for at such great cost," said UC Berkeley law
professor Frank Zimring, "is essentially our own ambivalence about
capital punishment. We try to maintain the apparatus of state killing
and another apparatus that almost guarantees that it won't happen. The
public pays for both sides."<br>
<br>
According to state and federal records obtained by The Times,
maintaining the California death penalty system costs taxpayers more
than $114 million a year beyond the cost of simply keeping the convicts
locked up for life and not counting the millions more in court costs
needed to prosecute capital cases and hold post-conviction hearings in
state and federal courts.<br>
<br>
With 11 executions spread over 27 years, on a per-execution basis,
California and federal taxpayers have paid more than a quarter of a
billion dollars for each life taken at state hands.<br>
<br>
Capital punishment advocates argue that the death penalty saves money
by eliminating state costs of housing the executed inmates. The rare
California executions do produce some savings for the state. For
example, had Beardsley lived to age 77, the average life expectancy for
California males, it would have cost the state an additional $2 million
to house him. But these kinds of savings make only a small dent in the
overall sums needed to maintain the system.<br>
<br>
Former California Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, now a Republican member of
Congress from Sacramento, accuses capital punishment opponents of
conducting a "war of attrition" against the death penalty, jacking up
the cost and greatly prolonging appeals with the intent of making the
process too expensive to keep up.<br>
<br>
"I don't think society ought to be forced to give up the death penalty
just because of actions by those who have been ratcheting up the
costs," said Lungren, who helped write a 1996 federal law attempting to
speed up capital case appeals. "It is very difficult to calculate the
human costs or even the economic costs of those who are not killed
because of the deterrence of capital punishment."<br>
<br>
Other states execute much more rapidly than California. Eleven Southern
states &#8212; led by Texas (337 executions), Virginia (94) and Oklahoma (75)
&#8212; account for 90% of all executions in the last 27 years. This is
partly because California, similar to other non-Southern capital
punishment states, dedicates much more time and money to state and
federal appeals.<br>
<br>
Another important factor is that the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals,
serving California and consisting largely of Democratic appointees, is
more likely to hear death penalty petitions than the more conservative
appeals courts serving Texas (5th Circuit) and Virginia (4th Circuit).<br>
<br>
"We don't turn them [executions] out the way a lot of Southern states
do," California Chief Justice Ronald M. George said in an interview.
"The virtue of our system is also its vice. We go to such lengths to
minimize the possibility of error, and we've built in a lot of delay.<br>
<br>
"The part I find most dysfunctional is that we have a delay of three to
four years between the time the death penalty judgment is imposed by
the trial court and the time the defendant is appointed counsel."<br>
<br>
George said that 115 death row inmates still have not been appointed
lawyers for the first direct appeal to the state Supreme Court that is
mandated by state law. And 149 lack lawyers for state habeas corpus and
executive clemency petitions.<br>
<br>
In recent years, both state and federal courts have increased the
incentives for qualified defense attorneys to take death penalty cases.
The state Supreme Court offers $125 an hour or fixed fees ranging from
$135,000 to $314,000 for capital case defense representation. The
federal courts recently increased their hourly rate to $150 for defense
lawyers in capital cases.<br>
<br>
But even at those rates, only a relative handful of attorneys from the
200,000 licensed to practice in California are willing to devote the
years of work and vast number of filings a typical capital case can
take.<br>
<br>
Because of the long appeals process, the delay between sentencing and
execution in California averages nearly 20 years. As a result, there is
a general graying of the population on death row. According to
Department of Corrections statistics, 180 death row inmates are older
than 50; 42 are older than 60.<br>
<br>
Prison records show that California death row inmates are far more
likely to die of natural causes than they are at the hands of the
executioner. Since 1978, during the same period that 11 inmates were
put to death, 28 died naturally, 12 committed suicide and two were
killed in incidents on the San Quentin exercise yard.<br>
<br>
"The leading cause of death on death row," George said, "is old age."<br>
<br>
Capital punishment California style has become a small industry. Every
February, organizers with the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice
and California Public Defenders Assn. host a conference on death
penalty issues in Monterey, Calif.<br>
<br>
This year's convention, titled "Executing Justice, not People," was
held at a cost of $300 a head. More than 1,500 participants attended
workshops on topics that included "What the Enemy Is Doing" and "Sexual
Abuse of Our Clients When They Were Young."<br>
<br>
Among the tactics routinely discussed by attendees is how to prolong
appeals.<br>
<br>
The public cost of maintaining the death penalty, meanwhile, continues
to mount. The annual bill breaks down like this:<br>
<br>
&#8226;&nbsp; According to Corrections Department spokeswoman Margot Bach, it
costs $90,000 more a year to house an inmate on death row, where each
person has a private cell and extra guards, than in the general prison
population. That accounts for $57.5 million annually.<br>
<br>
&#8226;&nbsp; Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, whose deputies represent the counties
during appeals, estimates that he devotes about 15% of his criminal
division budget to capital cases, or about $11 million annually.<br>
<br>
&#8226;&nbsp; The California Supreme Court, which is required by law to
review every death penalty case, spends $11.8 million annually for
court-appointed defense counsel.<br>
<br>
&#8226;&nbsp; The Office of the State Public Defender, which represents some
death row inmates, has an annual budget of $11.3 million. The San
Francisco-based Habeas Corpus Resource Center, another state-funded
office, represents inmates and trains death penalty attorneys on a
budget of $11 million.<br>
<br>
&#8226;&nbsp; Finally, federal public defenders offices in Los Angeles and
Sacramento, and private attorneys appointed by the federal court system
for California cases, receive about $12 million annually.<br>
<br>
The resulting $114-million annual cost does not include the substantial
extra funds needed to try the complicated capital cases in county
courts.<br>
<br>
Research by the UC Berkeley School of Public Policy in 1993, the most
recent study of its type available, showed that in Los Angeles County,
a capital murder trial costs three times more to try than a noncapital
murder case, $1.9 million compared to $630,000. One reason for the
extra costs is that capital cases require a jury trial for sentencing
after guilt has been determined in the first trial.<br>
<br>
Typically, capital cases have four times as many pretrial motions, more
investigators and expert testimony and much more exhaustive jury
selection.<br>
<br>
Other spending not included in the total are courtroom, staff and
filing costs at the California Supreme Court, four federal district
courts and the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.<br>
<br>
In an interview, George estimated that the state's highest court spends
about 20% of its time and resources on death penalty cases alone.
Federal habeas corpus appeals in death cases are so expensive that the
9th Circuit assigns a U.S. district judge just to review the budgets of
each capital case.<br>
<br>
For the present, activists both for and against the death penalty are
unhappy.<br>
<br>
"When we reinstated the death penalty, I don't think anyone believed it
would look like it does today," said Dane Gillette, a senior assistant
attorney general who overseas the state's death penalty cases. "The
system is twisted and corrupted in ways that were not anticipated."<br>
<br>
Michael Laurence, director of the Habeas Corpus Resource Center and one
of the state's leading capital defense lawyers, sees the whole process
as an enormous misuse of resources.<br>
<br>
"We put all these resources into litigation where we end up killing one
person every two or three years," said Laurence. "What if just a small
portion of the money we spent on these cases went for the prevention of
child abuse? From my experience, this would have done far more to
prevent murders than anything we have done with capital punishment."<br>
<br>
Possibly as a result of the high costs and bottleneck on death row,
there has been a marked decline in death sentences in recent years. In
1999, juries imposed 42 death sentences. In 2004, the number dropped to
nine.<br>
<br>
But the numbers fluctuate, and new admissions to California's death row
continue to exceed by many times the number of executions.<br>
<br>
USC law professor Michael J. Brennan said he and a co-counsel, Los
Angeles lawyer Phillip A. Trevino, have represented two California
death row inmates on federal appeals for the last 12 years, for which
Brennan estimates they have been paid $250,000.<br>
<br>
Brennan said that when he debates the issue with death penalty
supporters, he no longer bothers with the ethical and moral issues.<br>
<br>
"I had a conversation with someone recently who admitted to being sort
of a redneck on the death penalty," Brennan said recently. "But when I
said, 'Let's talk about how much it costs,' I suddenly got his
attention."<br>
