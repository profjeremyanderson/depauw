                  some exam questions. Also, if class is taught
                  remotely, sessions will be recorded and the recordings

              The best way to prepare is to keep up each week. When new
              questions are added, use the texts and notes (and
              classmates -- group study is helpful) to remind yourself
              of the relevant material, write out the best answers you
              can, and study them periodically.<br>

            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. On the first day of class
              we listed several reasons why one should, or should not,
              hook up with a stranger when one's significant other is
              away. These reasons fell into three groups (the columns).
              First, identify the three groups and, for each one,
              identify two of the reasons in that group. Finally, name
              the type of ethical theory which corresponds to each
              group. (A photo of the blackboard will be in the Class
              Notes folder linked from our Moodle page under Study
              Materials.)<br>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
                style="text-decoration: line-through;">2. Cephalus says
                that justice is being truthful and giving back what you
                have taken from another (Plato, 5). Why does Socrates
                reject this definition? (See the </span><a
                style="text-decoration: line-through;" target="_blank"

                Answers</a><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">
                for advice on answering this and other exam questions.)</span><br>
              <br>
              3. In class we saw that Cephalus, Socrates, and
              Polemarchus hold what we called conventional assumptions
              about justice (Plato, 5-14 <a
                href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/passim"><span
                  style="font-style: italic;">passim</span></a>; Phil
              230, 2025-08-22). What are these assumptions?<br>
              <br>
              4. Explain what Thrasymachus means when he says that
              &#8220;justice is nothing other than what is advantageous for
              the stronger&#8221; (Plato, 15).<br>
              <br>
              5. Thrasymachus argues that being just does not benefit
              you--rather, it is bad for you--and that "justice" is
              really a sort of scam used to exploit the weak. What
              evidence does Thrasymachus give for this (Plato, 15-22,
              especially 21-22)?<br>
              <br>
              6. How does Thrasymachus's view of justice challenge each
              of the conventional assumptions about justice (Phil 230,
              2025-08-22)?<br>
              <br>
              7. Define these terms as they are used in this course:
              &#8220;moral skepticism,&#8221; &#8220;moral subjectivism,&#8221; &#8220;cultural
              relativism,&#8221; and &#8220;ethical objectivism&#8221; (Class recording
              assigned for 2025-08-29; class notes from 2025-09-03).<br>
              <br>
              8. Benedict describes two main kinds of cultural
              differences. The first kind is where people we have
              labeled "abnormal" and unfit have a respected, though not
              necessarily central, place in other societies (Benedict,
              1-2). Explain one of Benedict's examples of that kind of
              difference.<br>
              <br>
              9. Benedict says, "The most spectacular illustrations of
              the extent to which normality may be culturally defined
              are those cultures where an abnormality of our culture is
              the cornerstone of their social structure" (3). First,
              explain what this sentence means. Then, pick one of the
              cultures she uses to illustrate this point (3-4), and
              explain how that culture's practices are supposed to
              support Benedict's claim.<br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 10. Explain
                how Benedict uses her examples of difference to support
                cultural relativism. In class (the recording for
                2025-08-29 and in person 2025-09-05), this was
                summarized in "Benedict's argument"; state that 4-step
                argument.</span><br>
              <br>
              11. State the "Cultural Differences Argument" (CDA)
              (Rachels, 3). Why does Rachels think the CDA is bad (3-4)?
              Why does his rejection of it nevertheless fail as an
              attack on Benedict's view (Phil 230, 2025-09-03)?<br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 12. Rachels
                says, &#8220;There are some moral rules that all societies
                must have in common, because those rules are necessary
                for society to exist&#8221; (7). Explain the examples he uses
                to support this claim.</span><br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 13. King
                describes how Black Americans were treated under
                segregation (King, 14). What would a moral skeptic say
                about whether that treatment was wrong? What would a
                moral subjectivist say? A cultural relativist (remember
                this one is tricky)?</span><br>
              <br>
              14. King says (15) that we should obey just laws but
              disobey unjust laws. How does King believe we can
              objectively distinguish just laws from unjust laws (King,
              16)? (Discussing King's examples from paragraphs 17-19 may
              be helpful, but it is most important to explain what he
              says in paragraph 16.)<br>
              <br>
              15. In class we raised some worries about Rachels
              (specifically, about his claim that some rules are
              justified because society cannot exist without them, 7;
              Phil 230, 2025-09-03) and about King's claims re how we
              can objectively distinguish just laws from unjust laws
              (King, 16; Phil 230, 2025-09-05). Explain one of our
              worries about Rachels, and one of our worries about King.
              <br>
              <br>
              16. Aquinas argues for ethical objectivism by saying that
              human nature -- specifically, our natural "inclinations"
              -- provide an objective basis for judging human laws. What
              inclinations does Aquinas identify (<span
                style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>, 4-5; Aquinas
              explainer video; Aquinas chart)? What "precepts of natural
              law" does Aquinas derive from these inclinations?<br>
              <br>
              17. What does it mean to say that the precepts of natural
              law are <span style="font-style: italic;">vague</span>,
              and that they are <span style="font-style: italic;">authoritative</span>?
              What are the implications of them being vague, and of them
              being authoritative? Give an example to illustrate how the
              precepts might be used to criticize a society's law.
              (Class notes and the Aquinas explainer video and chart
              have the answers.)<br>

              <br>
              20. Glaucon describes "what justice is like and what its
              origins are" (Plato, 37-8). What four claims about human
              nature does he make there (or, rather, what four claims
              does he think most people believe)?<br>
              <br>
              21. Suppose Glaucon's four claims about human nature are
              true. What, then, does Glaucon think we should do (Plato,
              37)? What, then, is Glaucon implying about us &amp;
              society?<br>
              <br>
              22. In class we discussed what people would do if they had
              a ring that would enable them to do as they please. What
              were the results -- would people generally behave justly
              or not? How does that relate to Glaucon's claims about
              human nature?<br>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
                style="text-decoration: line-through;">23. What four
                things must all consequentialist ethical theories do?
                Why, then, can there be many different consequentialist
                theories? In your answer, be sure to identify the
                different possible kinds of accounts of the good, and at
                least three possible scopes.</span><br>
              <br>
              24. How does classical utilitarianism (CU) do the four
              things consequentialist theories do? Why does Bentham
              think CU's account of the good is correct (Bentham, 1)?<br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 25. State
                the Principle of Utility, either from class or from
                Bentham's or Mill&#8217;s text (Bentham, 1; Mill calls it the
                &#8220;Greatest Happiness Principle,&#8221; 1). What steps should
                you take to apply the PU properly? (Bentham's
                description in section V on pp. 3-4 may be helpful
                here.) Finally, explain why classical utilitarianism has
                the "accounting problem" we discussed in class. </span><br>
              <br>
              26. How does Bentham think we should rank pleasures? Take
              two very different activities (maybe, eating Cheetos or
              watching a film like <a
                href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/"><span
                  style="font-style: italic;">Parasite</span></a>) and
              explain how Bentham's scheme might rank them, using the
              factors he mentions (Bentham, 3). (Well, you don't have to
              use all; let's say, use four of them). Which of your two
              activities would be better, according to Bentham's scheme,
              and why?<br>
              <br>
              27. What is the "swine problem"? In other words, why has
              utilitarianism been accused of being "a doctrine worthy
              only of swine" (Mill, 1)?<br>
              <br>
              <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);
                text-decoration: line-through;">28. </span><span
                style="text-decoration: line-through;">Discuss Mill's
                first response to utilitarianism's swine problem. In
                doing so, be sure to answer the following questions.
                What are the pleasures Mill says that only humans can
                enjoy (Mill, 1)? How does he try to show that we value
                them much more highly (Mill, 2)? If Mill were right, how
                might that solve the swine problem? Finally, in class we
                noted a problem -- the "snob problem" -- with Mill's
                response to the swine problem. What was it?</span><br>
              <br>
              29. Explain Mill's response to utilitarianism's
              "accounting problem." What does he say most of us may do,
              most of the time? How does Mill argue that some people
              have more responsibility than others (Mill, 5)? (In class
              this was compared to the <a target="_blank"
                href="Spider-Man_Rule.jpg">Spider-Man Rule</a>.)
              Finally, what concern was raised in class about Mill's
              solution?<br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 30. Rawls
                says there is "a way of thinking of society which makes
                it easy to suppose that the most rational conception of
                justice is utilitarian" (1). What is that way of
                thinking? Why, according to Rawls, is that way of
                thinking nevertheless wrong (Rawls 1, 3)? </span><br>
              <br>
              31. Explain why utilitarianism would say that, in Le
              Guin&#8217;s imaginary city of Omelas, it is morally right for
              the citizens to persecute the child. Why does this make
              utilitarianism objectionable?<br>
              <br>
              32. What is the "moral conservative" objection to
              consequentialism (Nielsen, 219)? What is Nielsen's
              strategy for countering this objection (Phil 230,
              2024-09-24)?<br>
              <br>
              <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">33. </span>Moral













              conservatives have used magistrate-type cases to object to
              consequentialism, saying consequentialism requires
              deliberately harming the innocent. How does Nielsen argue
              that moral conservatives need not object to
              consequentialism for how it deals with the magistrate case
              (223-5)? (Be sure to discuss what he says could happen if
              word gets out, 224.) How satisfactory is Nielsen's
              argument here? Give the strongest reasons you can to agree
              with you.<br>
              <br>
              <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">34. </span>Nielsen


































              says consequentialism may clearly require harming the
              innocent sometimes -- for example, in the case of the fat
              man stuck in the cave mouth (Nielsen, 222). How does he
              argue that this is the right thing to do here (228-30)?
              (Your answer will be better if you can say something about
              how Nielsen responds to concerns about callousness, using
              the fat man as a means, and/or inhumanity, 228-30.) How
              satisfactory is his argument regarding this case? Give the
              strongest reasons you can to agree with you.<br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Advice: </span>some
              exam questions, like #33 and 34, ask you to give your
              opinion and your reasons for it. The best strategy is to:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>First, before giving your opinion, explain what the
                  author says in as much detail as you can. That will
                  give you things to think critically about. You might
                  agree with part of it but disagree with another part,
                  for example. <br>
                </li>
                <li>Second, when giving your opinion, give independent
                  reasons; <span style="font-style: italic;">don't just
                    echo the author's own reasons</span>. For example,
                  saying "I agree with Nielsen in the fat man case
                  because blowing the fat man up is the lesser evil"
                  does not demonstrate any thought on your part. If you
                  can't say much more than that, I suggest answering a
                  different question.</li>
              </ul>
              35. Define the following terms as they are used in this
              course: &#8220;act utilitarianism,&#8221; &#8220;rule utilitarianism&#8221;
              (Hospers, 4, 10; class notes).<br>
              <br>
              36. Hospers presents several cases at the beginning of his
              article: a student seeking an undeserved grade; a thief
              seeking release; a district attorney considering whether
              to keep an innocent man in jail; and voting (Hospers, 1-2,
              3-4). Pick just one of these cases, and explain why
              act-utilitarianism would recommend one choice while
              rule-utilitarianism would recommend a different choice in
              that case.<br>
              <br>
              37. According to Hospers, what is wrong with having simple
              rules such as &#8220;do not lie&#8221; or &#8220;do not kill&#8221; (Hospers, 8-9,
              10)? Why does he think it would also be bad to have rules
              like this: &#8220;do not ____, except where it will do the most
              good&#8221; (11-2)? What sort of rules does Hospers think we
              should have (9)?<br>
              <br>
              38. Singer states a moral principle, but gives two
              versions of it: a "strong" one and a "moderate" one
              (Singer, 231). What is the "strong" one? How is it more
              demanding (require more sacrifice) than the "moderate"
              one?<br>
              <br>
              39. What is Singer's "moderate" principle (Singer, 231)?
              How does Singer use the example of the child drowning in
              the pond to illustrate this principle?<br>
              <br>
              40. How do we normally think about giving money to help
              needy people? How does Singer think we are mistaken (235)?<br>
              <br>
              41. Among Harwood&#8217;s eleven objections to utilitarianism
              are that it fails to take promises seriously enough (#4;
              Harwood, 6-7); it overstates our duties to animals (#8;
              Harwood, 11); and that it panders to bigots and sadists
              (#9; Harwood, 11-2). Pick one of these objections and
              explain it. That is, put the objection in your own words
              and make clear how it is supposed to give us a reason to
              reject utilitarianism.<br>
              <br>
              42. Harrison and Harwood (in Harwood, 9-10) object to rule
              utilitarianism (RU) on several grounds. In class, they
              were presented as a dilemma: either (a) RU always says to
              do the same thing as act utilitarianism, or (b) at least
              sometimes RU says to do something different from AU; but
              RU is objectionable either way. Explain this dilemma,
              being sure to make clear why both (a) and (b) are said to
              imply problems for RU.<br>

            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">43. Lecture discussed three
              types of <span style="font-style: italic;">deontological
              </span>ethical theories, which were distinguished by how
              we are supposed to know what is right and wrong (Phil 230,
              2025-10-08). Identify and define these three types. Of
              these three, which type is Kant's theory?<br>
              <br>
              44. Kant says this about the nature of moral laws and the
              proper sort of justification for them:<br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">That there must be [a
                &#8220;pure&#8221; moral] philosophy is evident from the common idea
                of duty and of moral laws. Everyone must admit that if a
                law is to be morally valid, i.e., is to be valid as a
                ground of obligation, then it must carry with it
                absolute necessity. He must admit that the command,
                &#8220;Thou shalt not lie,&#8221; does not hold only for men, as if
                other rational beings had no need to abide by it, and so
                with all the other moral laws properly so called. And he
                must concede that the ground of obligation here must
                therefore be sought not in the world in which man is
                placed, but must be sought...solely in the concepts of
                pure reason.... (Kant, 1).<br>
              </div>
              <br>
              Without using Kant's words, explain how Kant argues here
              that the justification of moral laws must come from pure
              reason.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              45. What does Kant mean by "rational being"? Why are
              rational beings not necessarily human? Why are some human
              beings not rational beings?<br>
              <br>
              46. Given Kant's commitment to justifying moral laws by
              pure reason, explain why Kant would reject some other
              views we have looked at in the course. Pick two of the
              following: (a) moral subjectivism, (b) cultural
              relativism; (c) Aquinas' natural law theory, (d) Glaucon's
              social contract; or (e) Bentham &amp; Mill's classical
              utilitarianism. Identify specific things about each one
              you choose that would lead Kant to reject it.<br>
              <br>
              47. Lecture discussed why our motives are important in
              ethics (Phil 230, 2025-10-20). Give an example of some
              action, and explain how having different motives could
              make that act morally right or morally wrong. (You could
              use an example from class or make up another example.)<br>
              <br>
              48. According to Kant, what are "inclinations" (Phil 230,
              2025-10-20)? Why does Kant say that there may never have
              been a truly moral action (7)? To answer this, it will
              help to explain how inclinations are (a) unreliable guides
              (Kant, 1) and (b) sneaky (that is, unseen by us; 7).
              Finally, what does Kant think a truly moral action would
              be? <br>
              <br>
              49. Explain how Kant's categorical imperative
              (specifically the formula of universal law) logically
              follows from the idea of a moral law (Phil 230,
              2025-10-22). Then, using either Kant's wording or our
              rewording of it, state Kant's formula of universal law. <br>
              <br>
              50. What is a maxim? (Feldman discusses maxims on pp. 2-4,
              but the discussion in class 2025-10-22 may be more
              accessible, and class notes include a definition.)&nbsp;
              Give 2 examples of maxims.<br>
              <br>
              51. In class we discussed the maxim, "When I need money I
              shall rob a bank to get it." Why does this maxim fail? (In
              other words, explain why it fails the 4-stage test given
              in class 2025-10-22.)<br>
              <br>
              52. Kant gives an example of someone making a false
              promise (Kant, 11, #2, from "Another man in need...").
              Using the 4-stage test given in class (2025-10-22 and
              -24), explain how to test it. According to Kant, why does
              this maxim fail?<br>
              <br>
              53. Lecture included Kant's example of refusing to give to
              the needy (Kant, 11-12, #4, from "A fourth man..."). What
              is the maxim in this case? According to Kant, why does it
              fail? How is the failure here different from the failure
              in the false promise case?<br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Situation (borrowed from
                Bernard Williams, 3): </span>George has just earned his
              Ph.D. in chemistry. His only job offer is at a chemical
              weapons lab. Taking the job would be against his
              conscience, but if he doesn't take the job, his family
              will have no income and Zack will take the
              chemical-weapons job and enthusiastically pursue the
              research, creating more horrible ways to kill people. <br>

                the four-step test for applying Kant&#8217;s formula of
                universal law, determine whether George may take the
                job. To do this well you will have to explain each stage
                carefully, especially stage 3 and, if you get to it, 4.<br>
              </div>
              <br>
              55. According to lecture, what would we like to get from
              any good ethical theory?<br>
              <br>
              56. Feldman criticizes Kant&#8217;s formula of universal law for
              permitting some actions which really are wrong (Feldman,
              14-5). Give an example of this--one of Feldman&#8217;s, or one
              from class, or your own--and explain how it demonstrates
              this problem.<br>
              <br>
              57. Feldman argues that Kant&#8217;s formula of universal law is
              faulty because it forbids some actions which really should
              be allowed (Feldman, 15). Give an example of this, and
              explain how it demonstrates this problem. (The example may
              be one of Feldman&#8217;s, or one from class, or your own.)<br>
              <br>
              58. Using the example of choosing whether to keep a lunch
              date or give aid to an accident victim (Ross, 2), explain
              what Ross thinks is wrong with Kantianism.<br>
              <br>
              59. Using the example of choosing whether to keep a lunch
              date or aid an accident victim (Ross, 2), explain what
              Ross thinks is wrong with utilitarianism. Be sure to
              explain how Ross thinks that utilitarianism oversimplifies
              our relationships with others, and how Ross's view is
              different (2-3).<br>
              <br>
              60. Given the problems he identifies with Kantianism and
              utilitarianism, what features does Ross think a proper
              ethical theory should have (Phil 230, 2025-10-29)? <br>
              <br>
              61. According to Ross, what does it mean to say our duties
              are "<span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span>"(Ross,


















              3, 5; Phil 230, 2025-10-29)? Identify six of our <span
                style="font-style: italic;">prima facie </span>duties,
              according to Ross (3-4).<br>
              <br>
              62. How does Ross think we should decide what to do (3;
              notes from 2024-11-04 will be helpful)? <br>

                you are George. Adopt Ross&#8217;s ethical theory. Explain
                whether you would take the job or not, and how you would
                arrive at that decision. To do so, first identify at
                least three relationships that are salient in this
                situation, and at least three <span style="font-style:
                  italic;">prima facie </span>duties arising from those
                relationships which apply in this situation. (By "at
                least three" I mean that is the minimum for a passable
                answer.) Given those duties to those people, and
                considering the situation, which duty (or duties) is

              reasons why we do bad things (see 2025-11-07 class notes).
              Identify three of them. Explain why they (mostly) are
              failures of character rather than failures of our ethical
              theories. How does this suggest that virtue theory has
              some value?<br>
              <br>
              65. Describe the "parts" Plato thinks the soul has (Plato,
              129-31). According to Plato, what is the proper division
              of labor among the soul's parts (131)--in other words,
              what 'job' should each part do?<br>
              <br>
              66. Describe Plato's ideal soul. What are the virtues it
              would have, and which part(s) have them?<br>

              to Aristotle, why is happiness super important in ethics
              (Aristotle 1-2)? In your explanation, include why
              Aristotle thinks happiness is "complete,"
              "self-sufficient," and the "most choiceworthy" good. Why,
              then, is it important to know what happiness is
              (Aristotle, 1)?<br>
              <br>
              69. According to Aristotle, what is human happiness (3)?
              How does Aristotle figure that out? (I.e., explain the
              function argument, pp. 2-3.)<br>
              <br>
              70. Aristotle explains why "what is true of crafts is not
              true of virtue" (4). How do they differ? What three
              criteria does Aristotle say must be met for you to be "in
              the right state" (4)? <br>
              <br>
              <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">71. </span>Aristotle































              defines virtue as a state where (a) you decide, and your
              decision (b) consists of a mean; and this mean (c) is
              relative to you, (d) is defined by reason, and (e) is a
              mean between two vices -- one of excess and one of
              deficiency (Aristotle, 6). Pick one of the virtues
              Aristotle discusses on pp. 7-8. For each point (a) through
              (e), explain how that virtue would exemplify that point.
              (You might think of it this way: explain how each of those
              points is manifested in a person who possesses that
              virtue.) Finally, explain why someone is likely to be
              better off behaving along the mean than not.<br>
              <br>
              72. Given Aristotle's conception of virtue, explain why
              becoming a virtuous person is very challenging. In other
              words, why does Aristotle say "it is...hard work to be
              excellent" (9)? <br>
