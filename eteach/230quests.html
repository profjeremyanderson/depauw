              As noted on the syllabus, I offer several kinds of help

                  some exam questions. Also, if class is taught
                  remotely, sessions will be recorded and the recordings

              The best way to prepare is to keep up each week. When new
              questions are added, use the texts and notes (and
              classmates -- group study is helpful) to remind yourself
              of the relevant material, write out the best answers you
              can, and study them periodically.<br>

            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. In class we listed many
              reasons why one should, or should not, hook up with a
              stranger when one's significant other is away. These
              reasons fell into three groups (the columns). First,
              identify the three groups and, for each one, identify one
              of the reasons in that group. Finally, name the type of
              ethical theory which corresponds to each group.<br>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
                style="text-decoration: line-through;">2. Cephalus says
                that justice is being truthful and giving back what you
                have taken from another (Plato, 5). Why does Socrates
                reject this definition? (See the </span><a
                style="text-decoration: line-through;" target="_blank"

                Answers</a><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">
                for advice on answering this and other exam questions.)</span><br>
              <br>
              3. In class we saw that Cephalus, Socrates, and
              Polemarchus hold what we called conventional assumptions
              about justice (Plato, 5-14 <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/passim"><span
                  style="font-style: italic;">passim</span></a>; Phil
              230, 2024-08-23). What are these assumptions?<br>
              <br>
              4. Explain what Thrasymachus means when he says that
              &#8220;justice is nothing other than what is advantageous for
              the stronger&#8221; (Plato, 15).<br>
              <br>
              5. Thrasymachus defends his moral skepticism by arguing
              that being just does not benefit you--rather, it is bad
              for you--and that "justice" is really a sort of scam used
              to exploit the weak. What evidence does Thrasymachus give
              for this (Plato, 15-22, especially 21-22)?<br>
              <br>
              6. How does Thrasymachus's view of justice challenge each
              of the conventional assumptions about justice (Phil 230,
              2024-08-23)?<br>
              <br>
              7. Define these terms as they are used in this course:
              &#8220;moral skepticism,&#8221; &#8220;moral subjectivism,&#8221; &#8220;cultural
              relativism,&#8221; and &#8220;ethical objectivism&#8221; (Phil 230,
              2024-08-26).<br>
              <br>
              8. Benedict describes two main kinds of cultural
              differences. The first kind is where people we have
              labeled "abnormal" and unfit have a respected, though not
              necessarily central, place in other societies (Benedict,
              1-2). Explain one of Benedict's examples of that kind of
              difference.<br>
              <br>
              9. Benedict says, "The most spectacular illustrations of
              the extent to which normality may be culturally defined
              are those cultures where an abnormality of our culture is
              the cornerstone of their social structure" (3). First,
              explain what this sentence means. Then, pick one of the
              cultures she uses to illustrate this point (3-4), and
              explain how that culture's practices are supposed to
              support Benedict's claim.<br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 10. Explain
                how Benedict uses her examples of difference to support
                cultural relativism. In class, this was summarized in
                "Benedict's argument"; state that 4-step argument.</span><br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 11. State
                the "Cultural Differences Argument" (Rachels, 3). Why
                does Rachels think it is bad (3-4)? Why does his
                rejection of it nevertheless fail as an attack on
                Benedict's view (Phil 230, 2024-08-28)?</span><br>
              <br>
              12. Rachels says, &#8220;There are some moral rules that all
              societies must have in common, because those rules are
              necessary for society to exist&#8221; (7). Explain the examples
              he uses to support this claim.<br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 13. King
                describes how Black Americans were treated under
                segregation (King, 14). What would a moral skeptic say
                about whether that treatment was wrong? What would a
                moral subjectivist say? A cultural relativist (remember
                this one is tricky)?</span><br>
              <br>
              14. King says (15) that we should obey just laws but
              disobey unjust laws. How does King believe we can
              objectively distinguish just laws from unjust laws (King,
              16)? (Discussing King's examples from paragraphs 17-19 may
              be helpful, but it is most important to explain what he
              says in paragraph 16.)<br>
              <br>
              15. In class we raised several worries about Rachels
              (specifically, his claim that some rules are justified
              because society cannot exist without them, 7; Phil 230,
              2024-08-28) and about King's claims re how we can
              objectively distinguish just laws from unjust laws (King,
              16; Phil 230, 2024-08-30). Explain one of our worries
              about Rachels, and one of our worries about King. <br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 16. Aquinas
                argues for ethical objectivism by saying that human
                nature -- specifically, our natural "inclinations" --
                provide an objective basis for judging human laws. What
                inclinations does Aquinas identify (</span><span

                how Aquinas might try to resolve the dispute between
                Adara and Beth. In other words, given what Aquinas says
                in the assigned reading, is there any prospect of
                resolving their dispute? What might it be? (What&#8217;s most
                important here is to give a sense of how Aquinas would
                approach this matter. The more thoroughly you can answer
                the other Aquinas questions, the better you will be able
                to explain that.)<br>

              <br>
              20. Glaucon describes "what justice is like and what its
              origins are" (Plato, 37-8). What four claims about human
              nature does he make there (or, rather, what four claims
              does he think most people believe)?<br>
              <br>
              21. Suppose Glaucon's four claims about human nature are
              true. What, then, does Glaucon think we should do (Plato,
              37)? What, then, is Glaucon implying about us &amp;
              society?<br>
              <br>
              22. In class we discussed what people would do if they had
              a ring that would enable them to do as they please. What
              were the results -- would people generally behave justly
              or not? How does that relate to Glaucon's claims about
              human nature?<br>

            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">23. What four things must
              all consequentialist ethical theories do? Why, then, can
              there be many different consequentialist theories? In your
              answer, be sure to identify the different possible kinds
              of accounts of the good, and at least three possible
              scopes.<br>
              <br>
              24. How does classical utilitarianism (CU) do the four
              things consequentialist theories do? Why does Bentham
              think CU's account of the good is correct (Bentham, 1)?<br>
              <br>
              25. State the Principle of Utility, either from class or
              from Bentham's or Mill&#8217;s text (Bentham, 1; Mill calls it
              the &#8220;Greatest Happiness Principle,&#8221; 1). What steps should
              you take to apply the PU properly? (Bentham's description
              in section V on pp. 3-4 may be helpful here.)<br>
              <br>
              26. Explain why classical utilitarianism has the
              "accounting problem" we discussed in class. How does
              Bentham respond to the problem (Bentham, 4, section VI)?<br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 27. How does
                Bentham think we should rank pleasures? Take two very
                different activities (maybe, eating Cheetos or watching
                a film like </span><span style="font-style: italic;
                text-decoration: line-through;">Parasite</span><span
                style="text-decoration: line-through;">) and explain how
                Bentham's scheme might rank them, using the factors he
                mentions (Bentham, 3). (Well, you don't have to use all;
                let's say, use four of them). Which of your two
                activities would be better, according to Bentham's
                scheme, and why?</span><br>
              <br>
              28. What is the "swine problem"? In other words, why has
              utilitarianism been accused of being "a doctrine worthy
              only of swine" (Mill, 1)?<br>
              <br>
              <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);

                style="text-decoration: line-through;">Discuss Mill's
                response to utilitarianism's swine problem. In doing so,
                be sure to answer the following questions. What are the
                pleasures Mill says that only humans can enjoy (Mill,
                1)? How does he try to show that we value them much more
                highly (Mill, 2)? If Mill were right, how might that
                solve the swine problem? Finally, in class we noted a
                problem -- the "snob problem" -- with Mill's response to
                the swine problem. What was it?</span><br>
              <br>
              30. Explain Mill's response to utilitarianism's
              "accounting problem." What does he say most of us may do,
              most of the time? How does Mill argue that some people
              have more responsibility than others (Mill, 5)? (In class
              this was compared to the <target="_blank"

                  href="Spider-Man_Rule.jpg">Spider-Man Rule</a>.)
                Finally, what concerns were raised in class about Mill's
                solution? <br>
                <br>
                31. Nozick gives three reasons why, he says, we would
                not plug in to the Experience Machine (Nozick, 43-4).
                What are they? If Nozick is right that we would not plug
                in to the Experience Machine <span style="font-style:
                  italic;">and </span>he is right about why we would
                not, how would that suggest a serious problem with
                classical utilitarianism? (The argument from the
                explainer video or the one given in class 2024-09-18
                will be useful here.)<br>
                <br>
                32. Explain why utilitarianism would say that, in Le
                Guin&#8217;s imaginary city of Omelas, it is morally right for
                the citizens to persecute the child. Why does this make
                utilitarianism objectionable?<br>
                <br>
                33. What is the "moral conservative" objection to
                consequentialism (Nielsen, 219)? What is Nielsen's
                strategy for countering this objection (Phil 230,
                2024-09-20)?<br>

                  style="text-decoration: line-through;">Moral
                  conservatives have used magistrate-type cases to
                  object to consequentialism, saying consequentialism
                  requires deliberately harming the innocent. How does
                  Nielsen argue that moral conservatives need not object
                  to consequentialism for how it deals with the
                  magistrate case (223-5)? (Be sure to discuss what he
                  says could happen if word gets out, 224.) How
                  satisfactory is Nielsen's argument here? Give the
                  strongest reasons you can to agree with you.</span><br>

                <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">35. </span>Nielsen

















                says consequentialism may clearly require harming the
                innocent sometimes -- for example, in the case of the
                fat man stuck in the cave mouth (Nielsen, 222). How does
                he argue that this is the right thing to do here
                (228-30)? (Your answer will be better if you discuss how
                Nielsen responds to concerns about callousness, using
                the fat man as a means, and/or inhumanity, 228-30.) How
                satisfactory is his argument regarding this case? Give
                the strongest reasons you can to agree with you.<br>
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Advice: </span>some
                exam questions, like #36 and 37, ask you to give your
                opinion and your reasons for it. The best strategy is
                to:<br>
                <ul>
                  <li>First, before giving your opinion, explain what
                    the author says in as much detail as you can. That
                    will give you things to think critically about. You
                    might agree with part of it but disagree with
                    another part, for example. <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Second, when giving your opinion, give independent
                    reasons; <span style="font-style: italic;">don't
                      just echo the author's own reasons</span>. For
                    example, saying "I agree with Nielsen in the fat man
                    case because blowing the fat man up is the lesser
                    evil" does not demonstrate any thought on your part.
                    If you can't say much more than that, I suggest
                    answering a different question.</li>

              </target="_blank"></div>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">36. Define the following
              terms as they are used in this course: &#8220;act
              utilitarianism,&#8221; &#8220;rule utilitarianism&#8221; (Hospers, 4, 10;
              class notes).<br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 37. Hospers
                presents several cases at the beginning of his article:
                a student seeking an undeserved grade; a thief seeking
                to be released; a district attorney considering whether
                to keep an innocent man in jail; and voting (Hospers,
                1-2, 3-4). Pick just one of these cases, and explain why
                act-utilitarianism would recommend one choice while
                rule-utilitarianism would recommend a different choice
                in that case.</span><br>
              <br>
              38. According to Hospers, what is wrong with having simple
              rules such as &#8220;do not lie&#8221; or &#8220;do not kill&#8221; (Hospers, 8-9,
              10)? Why does he think it would also be bad to have rules
              like this: &#8220;do not ____, except where it will do the most
              good&#8221; (11-2)? What sort of rules does Hospers think we
              should have (9)?<br>
              <br>
              39. What is "negative responsibility" (Williams, 2)? (He
              calls it "negative responsibility" or the "strong doctrine
              of negative responsibility.") Suppose Jim decides not to
              shoot one Indian when Pedro invites him to (cf. Williams,
              3-4). According to consequentialism, how responsible is
              Jim when Pedro orders twenty Indians shot?<br>
              <br>
              <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">40. </span>According






































              to Williams, what does utilitarianism say George should do
              about that job offer from the weapons lab (Williams, 3-4)?
              Why does Williams believe utilitarianism is wrong about
              that (2-3, 4-9)? (Yes this is challenging. Your answer
              should include the things Williams thinks are important in
              this case: negative responsibility (2-3), the impact of
              other people&#8217;s decisions on our projects and happiness
              (4-7), and the impact on our integrity (7-9).)<br>
              <br>
              41. How do we normally think about giving money to help
              needy people? Why does Singer say we are mistaken (235)?<br>
              <br>
              42. What is Singer's "moderate" principle (Singer, 231)?
              How does Singer use the example of the child drowning in
              the pond to illustrate this principle? <br>
              <br>
              43. Singer says that following even his "moderate"
              principle could affect "consumer society" (241-2). What
              impact does he say it might have? Why does he think that
              could be a good thing (in addition to helping the needy)?<br>
              <br>
              44. Among Harwood&#8217;s eleven objections to utilitarianism
              are that it fails to take promises seriously enough (#4;
              Harwood, 6-7); it overstates our duties to animals (#8;
              Harwood, 11); and that it panders to bigots and sadists
              (#9; Harwood, 11-2). Pick one of these objections and
              explain it. That is, put the objection in your own words
              and make clear how it is supposed to give us a reason to
              reject utilitarianism.<br>
              <br>
              45. When we discussed Harwood's objections to
              utilitarianism, we noted some moral intuitions that many
              of us share (Phil 230, 2024-10-04). What were they? How
              might they conflict with each other? <br>
              <br>
              46. Harrison and Harwood (in Harwood, 9-10) object to rule
              utilitarianism (RU) on several grounds. In class, they
              were presented as a dilemma: either (a) RU always says to
              do the same thing as act utilitarianism, or (b) at least
              sometimes RU says to do something different from AU; but
              RU is objectionable either way. Explain this dilemma,
              being sure to make clear why both (a) and (b) are said to
              imply problems for RU.<br>

              48. Kant says this about the nature of moral laws and the
              proper sort of justification for them:<br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">That there must be [a
                &#8220;pure&#8221; moral] philosophy is evident from the common idea
                of duty and of moral laws. Everyone must admit that if a
                law is to be morally valid, i.e., is to be valid as a
                ground of obligation, then it must carry with it
                absolute necessity. He must admit that the command,
                &#8220;Thou shalt not lie,&#8221; does not hold only for men, as if
                other rational beings had no need to abide by it, and so
                with all the other moral laws properly so called. And he
                must concede that the ground of obligation here must
                therefore be sought not in the world in which man is
                placed, but must be sought...solely in the concepts of
                pure reason.... (Kant, 1).<br>
              </div>
              <br>
              Without using Kant's words, explain how Kant argues here
              that the justification of moral laws must come from pure
              reason.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              49. What does Kant mean by "rational being"? Why are
              rational beings not necessarily human? Why are some human
              beings not rational beings?<br>
              <br>
              50. Given Kant's commitment to justifying moral laws by
              pure reason, explain why Kant would reject some other
              views we have looked at in the course. Pick <span
                style="font-style: italic;">two </span>of the
              following: (a) cultural relativism; (b) Aquinas' natural
              law theory, (c) Glaucon's social contract; or (d) Bentham
              &amp; Mill's classical utilitarianism. Identify specific
              things about each one you choose that would lead Kant to
              reject it.<br>
              <br>
              51. Lecture discussed why our motives are important in
              ethics (Phil 230, 2024-10-09). Give an example of some
              action, and explain how having different motives could
              make that act morally right or morally wrong. (You could
              use an example from class such as your boss giving you a
              gift, or make up another example.)<br>
              <br>
              52. According to Kant, what are "inclinations" (Phil 230,
              2024-10-09)? Why does Kant say that there may never have
              been a truly moral action (7)? To answer this, it will
              help to explain how inclinations are (a) unreliable guides
              (Kant, 1) and (b) sneaky (that is, unseen by us; 7).
              Finally, what does Kant think a truly moral action would
              be? <br>
              <br>
              53. Explain how Kant's categorical imperative
              (specifically the formula of universal law) logically
              follows from the idea of a moral law (Phil 230,
              2024-10-21). Then, using either Kant's wording or our
              rewording of it, state Kant's formula of universal law. <br>
              <br>
              54. What is a maxim? (Feldman discusses maxims on pp. 2-4,
              but the discussion in class 2024-10-21 may be more
              accessible, and class notes include a definition.)&nbsp;
              Give 2 examples of maxims.<br>
              <br>
              55. In class we discussed the maxim, "When I need money I
              shall rob a bank to get it." Why does this maxim fail? (In
              other words, explain why it fails the 4-stage test given
              in class 2024-10-23.)<br>
              <br>
              56. Kant gives an example of someone making a false
              promise (Kant, 11, #2, from "Another man in need...").
              Using the 4-stage test given in class (2024-10-23),
              explain how to test it. According to Kant, why does this
              maxim fail?<br>
              <br>
              57. Lecture included Kant's example of refusing to give to
              the needy (Kant, 11-12, #4, from "A fourth man..."). What
              is the maxim in this case? According to Kant, why does it
              fail? How is the failure here different from the failure
              in the false promise case?<br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Situation (from Williams,
                3): </span>George&#8217;s lack of a job is causing trouble at
              home. He is offered a research job at a chemical and
              biological weapons lab. Taking the job would be against
              his conscience because he opposes such weapons. But if
              George does not take the job, Zed will take it and
              enthusiastically pursue the research, creating more
              horrible ways to kill people.<br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
                  style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">58. </span>Using
































































                the four-stage test for applying Kant&#8217;s formula of
                universal law, determine whether George may take the
                job. To do this well you will have to explain each stage
                carefully, especially stage 3 and, if you get to it, 4.<br>
              </div>
              <br>
              59. According to lecture, what would we like to get from
              any good ethical theory?<br>
              <br>
              60. Feldman criticizes Kant&#8217;s formula of universal law for
              permitting some actions which really are wrong (Feldman,
              14-5). Give an example of this--one of Feldman&#8217;s, or one
              from class, or your own--and explain how it demonstrates
              this problem.<br>
              <br>
              61. Feldman argues that Kant&#8217;s formula of universal law is
              faulty because it forbids some actions which really should
              be allowed (Feldman, 15). Give an example of this, and
              explain how it demonstrates this problem. (The example may
              be one of Feldman&#8217;s, or one from class, or your own.)<br>
              <br>
              62. State Kant's categorical imperative, in the formula of
              humanity (FH) (Kant, 14; O'Neill, 259). Second, explain
              what Kant means by "humanity" here. Finally, identify the
              two distinct duties the FH implies we have (cf. O'Neill,
              260).<br>
              <br>
              63. According to Kant, what is the difference between
              treating someone <span style="font-style: italic;">as a
                means </span>and treating them <span
                style="font-style: italic;">merely </span>(or "simply")
              <span style="font-style: italic;">as means </span>(O'Neill,






              &sect;20, pp. 260-2)? What makes it OK to treat others as
              means, but not OK to treat them merely as means? (It may
              be helpful to consider some of O'Neill's examples
              regarding needy people.)<br>
              <br>
              64. According to Kant, what does it mean to treat humanity
              in ourselves and others as an end (O'Neill, &sect;21, p.
              262)? What sorts of things might this require us to do, or
              not do?<br>
              <br>
              65. Suppose you are wondering whether you may rob a bank.
              Would Kant's Formula of Humanity say that you may? Explain
              how come. Then, suppose you are wondering whether you may
              withdraw all your money from the bank when the stock
              market reaches 40,000. Again, would Kant's formula of
              Humanity permit this? Explain how come.<br>
              <br>
              66. Using the example of choosing whether to keep a lunch
              date or give aid to an accident victim (Ross, 2), explain
              what Ross thinks is wrong with Kantianism.<br>
              <br>
              67. Using the example of choosing whether to keep a lunch
              date or aid an accident victim (Ross, 2), explain what
              Ross thinks is wrong with utilitarianism. Be sure to
              explain how Ross thinks that utilitarianism oversimplifies
              our relationships with others, and how Ross's view is
              different (2-3).<br>
              <br>
              68. Given the problems he identifies with Kantianism and
              utilitarianism, what features does Ross think a proper
              ethical theory should have (Phil 230, 2024-11-01)? <br>
              <br>
              69. According to Ross, what does it mean to say our duties
              are "<span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span>"(Ross,






              3, 5; Phil 230, 2024-11-01)? Identify six of our <span
                style="font-style: italic;">prima facie </span>duties,
              according to Ross (3-4).<br>
              <br>
              70. How does Ross think we should decide what to do (3;
              notes from 2024-11-04 will be helpful)? <br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Situation: </span>See
              the situation described above for question 60 (George's
              job offer).<br>

                you are George. Adopt Ross&#8217;s ethical theory. Explain
                whether you would take the job or not, and how you would
                arrive at that decision. To do so, first identify at
                least three relationships that are salient in this
                situation, and at least three <span style="font-style:
                  italic;">prima facie </span>duties arising from those
                relationships which apply in this situation. (By "at
                least three" I mean that is the minimum for a passable
                answer.) Given those duties to those people, and
                considering the situation, which duty (or duties) is

              failures of character rather than failures of our ethical
              theories. How does this suggest that virtue theory has
              some value?<br>
              <br>
              73. Describe the "parts" Plato thinks the soul has (Plato,
              129-31). According to Plato, what is the proper division
              of labor among the soul's parts (131)--in other words,
              what 'job' should each part do?<br>
              <br>
              74. Describe Plato's ideal soul. What are the virtues it
              would have, and which part(s) have them?<br>
              <br>
              <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">75. </span>According


























              to Aristotle, why is happiness super important in ethics
              (Aristotle 1-2)? In your explanation, include why
              Aristotle thinks happiness is "complete,"
              "self-sufficient," and the "most choiceworthy" good. Why,
              then, is it important to know what happiness is
              (Aristotle, 1)?<br>
              <br>
              76. According to Aristotle, what is human happiness (3)?
              How does Aristotle figure that out? (I.e., explain the
              function argument, pp. 2-3.)<br>
              <br>
              77. Aristotle explains why "what is true of crafts is not
              true of virtue" (4). How do they differ? What three
              criteria does Aristotle say must be met for you to be "in
              the right state" (4)? <br>
              <br>
              <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">78. </span>Aristotle

























              defines virtue as a state where (a) you decide and your
              decision (b) consists of a mean; and this mean (c) is
              relative to you, (d) is defined by reason, and (e) is a
              mean between two vices -- one of excess and one of
              deficiency (Aristotle, 6). Pick one of the virtues
              Aristotle discusses on pp. 7-8. For each point (a) through
              (e), explain how that virtue would exemplify that point.
              (You might think of it this way: explain how each of those
              points is manifested in a person who possesses that
              virtue.) Finally, explain why someone is likely to be
              better off behaving along the mean than not.<br>
              <br>
              79. Given Aristotle's conception of virtue, explain why
              becoming a virtuous person is very challenging. In other
              words, why does Aristotle say "it is...hard work to be
              excellent" (9)? <br>
