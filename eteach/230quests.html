            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">All exams will consist of
              some of these questions.<br>
              <br>
              Questions that appeared on a previous exam will be struck

              As noted on the syllabus, I offer several kinds of help
              for you to give good answers:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>Citations in exam questions point you to material
                  needed for giving good answers. Use them.</li>

                  questions and advice on how to write better answers.</li>

                    on Moodle</a>. These will be helpful for answering
                  some exam questions. Also, if class is taught
                  remotely, sessions will be recorded and the recordings
                  will be there, too.</li>
                <li>You may <a href="230home.html#contact">email</a> me
                  your answers to up to three exam questions per week
                  and I will help you improve them</li>
                <li>We can discuss your answers <a
                    href="230home.html#contact">during office hours or
                    by appointment</a>. You may also form study groups
                  -- in fact, I encourage you to.</li>
                <li>There will be review sessions before each exam. See

              </ul>
              The best way to prepare is to keep up each week. When new
              questions are added, use the texts and notes (and
              classmates -- group study is helpful) to remind yourself
              of the relevant material, write out the best answers you
              can, and study them periodically.<br>

                questions about Ethical Theory (our first day)</span></font><br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. In class we listed many
              reasons why one should, or should not, hook up with a
              stranger when their significant other is away. These
              reasons fell into three main groups. Identify the three
              groups and, for each one, identify one of the reasons in
              that group. Name the type of ethical theory which
              corresponds to each group.<br>
              <br>
            </div>
            <br>
            <a name="basis_of_rules"></a><br>
            <font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exam
                questions about the basis of moral rules</span></font><br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">2. Cephalus believes that
              justice is being truthful and giving back what you have
              taken from another (Plato, 5). Why does Socrates reject
              this definition?<br>
              <br>
              3. In class we saw that Cephalus, Socrates, and
              Polemarchus hold what we called conventional assumptions
              about justice (Plato, 5-14 <span style="font-style:
                italic;">passim</span>; Phil 230, 2022-08-26). What are
              these assumptions?<br>
              <br>
              4. Explain what Thrasymachus means when he says that
              &#8220;justice is nothing other than what is advantageous for
              the stronger&#8221; (Plato, 15; Phil 230, 2022-08-26). How does
              this challenge conventional assumptions about justice?<br>
              <br>
              5. Thrasymachus defends his moral skepticism by arguing
              that being just does not benefit you--rather, it is bad
              for you--and that "justice" is really a sort of scam used
              to exploit the weak. What evidence does Thrasymachus give
              for this (Plato, 15-22, especially 21-22)?<br>
              <br>
              6. Define these terms as they are used in this course:
              &#8220;moral skepticism,&#8221; &#8220;moral subjectivism,&#8221; &#8220;cultural
              relativism,&#8221; and &#8220;ethical objectivism&#8221; (Phil 230,
              2022-08-29).<br>
              <br>
              7. Benedict describes two main kinds of cultural
              differences. One kind is where people we have labeled
              "abnormal" and unfit have a respected (though not
              necessarily central) place in other societies (Benedict,
              1-2). Explain one of Benedict's examples of that kind of
              difference.<br>
              <br>
              8. Benedict says, "The most spectacular illustrations of
              the extent to which normality may be culturally defined
              are those cultures where an abnormality of our culture is
              the cornerstone of their social structure" (3). First,
              explain what this sentence means. Then, pick one of the
              cultures she uses to illustrate this point (3-4), and
              explain how that culture's practices are supposed to
              support Benedict's claim.<br>
              <br>
              9. Explain how Benedict uses her examples of differences
              to support cultural relativism. In class, this was
              summarized in "Benedict's argument"; state that argument.
              <br>
              <br>
              10. State the "Cultural Differences Argument" (Rachels,
              3). Why does Rachels think it is bad (3-4)?<br>
              <br>
              11. Rachels says, &#8220;There are some moral rules that all
              societies must have in common, because those rules are
              necessary for society to exist&#8221; (7). Explain the examples
              he uses to support this claim.<br>
              <br>
              12. According to Rachels, there is a culture-neutral
              standard for telling whether moral rules are justified
              (Rachels, 9). What is it?<br>
              <br>
              13. King describes how Black Americans were treated under
              segregation (King, 14). What would a moral skeptic say
              about whether that treatment was wrong? What would a moral
              subjectivist say? A cultural relativist (remember this one
              is tricky)?<br>
              <br>
              14. King says we should obey just laws but disobey unjust
              laws (15). How does King believe we can we objectively
              distinguish just laws from unjust laws (King, 16)?
              (Discussing King's examples from paragraphs 17-19 may be
              helpful, but it is most important to explain what he says
              in paragraph 16.)<br>
              <br>
              15. Benedict observes individual cultures and finds
              differences among them. How does Aquinas differ? (Class
              notes and the Aquinas explainer video will be helpful
              here.)<br>
              <br>
              16. Aquinas argues for ethical objectivism by saying that
              human nature -- specifically, our natural inclinations --
              provide an objective basis for judging human laws. What
              are the inclinations Aquinas identifies (<span
                style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>, 4-5; Aquinas
              explainer video, Aquinas chart)? What precepts of natural
              law does Aquinas derive from these inclinations?<br>
              <br>
              17. What does it mean to say that the precepts of natural
              law are <span style="font-style: italic;">vague</span>,
              and that they are <span style="font-style: italic;">authoritative</span>?
              What are the implications of them being vague, and being
              authoritative? Give an example to illustrate how the
              precepts might be used to criticize a society's law.
              (Class notes and the Aquinas explainer video and chart
              will be helpful here.)<br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Situation: </span>Adara
              and Beth disagree. Adara is a conservative Saudi Muslim.
              Adara criticizes Beth for dressing immodestly because Beth
              does not cover her face or legs in public. Beth is an
              American liberal atheist. Beth criticizes Adara for
              wanting to restrict women&#8217;s freedom by dictating how they
              dress.<br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
                  style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">18. </span>Explain

                how Aquinas might try to resolve the dispute between
                Adara and Beth. In other words, given what Aquinas says
                in the assigned reading, is there any prospect of
                resolving their dispute? What might it be? (What&#8217;s most
                important here is to give a sense of how Aquinas would
                approach this matter. The more thoroughly you can answer
                the other Aquinas questions, the better you will be able
                to explain that.)<br>
