                  some exam questions. Also, if class is taught
                  remotely, sessions will be recorded and the recordings

              The best way to prepare is to keep up each week. When new
              questions are added, use the texts and notes (and
              classmates -- group study is helpful) to remind yourself
              of the relevant material, write out the best answers you
              can, and study them periodically.<br>

            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. In class we listed many
              reasons why one should, or should not, hook up with a
              stranger when one's significant other is away. These
              reasons fell into three groups (the columns). First,
              identify the three groups and, for each one, identify one
              of the reasons in that group. Finally, name the type of
              ethical theory which corresponds to each group.<br>
              <br>

            <font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exam
                questions about the basis of moral rules</span></font><br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">2. Cephalus says that
              justice is being truthful and giving back what you have
              taken from another (Plato, 5). Why does Socrates reject
              this definition? (See the <a target="_blank"
                href="https://moodle.depauw.edu/course/view.php?id=22648#section-4">Sample









                Answers</a> for advice on answering this and other exam
              questions.)<br>
              <br>
              3. In class we saw that Cephalus, Socrates, and
              Polemarchus hold what we called conventional assumptions
              about justice (Plato, 5-14 <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/passim"><span
                  style="font-style: italic;">passim</span></a>; Phil
              230, 2024-08-23). What are these assumptions?<br>
              <br>
              4. Explain what Thrasymachus means when he says that
              &#8220;justice is nothing other than what is advantageous for
              the stronger&#8221; (Plato, 15).<br>
              <br>
              5. Thrasymachus defends his moral skepticism by arguing
              that being just does not benefit you--rather, it is bad
              for you--and that "justice" is really a sort of scam used
              to exploit the weak. What evidence does Thrasymachus give
              for this (Plato, 15-22, especially 21-22)?<br>
              <br>
              6. How does Thrasymachus's view of justice challenge each
              of the conventional assumptions about justice (Phil 230,
              2024-08-23)?<br>
              <br>
              7. Define these terms as they are used in this course:
              &#8220;moral skepticism,&#8221; &#8220;moral subjectivism,&#8221; &#8220;cultural
              relativism,&#8221; and &#8220;ethical objectivism&#8221; (Phil 230,
              2024-08-26).<br>
              <br>
              8. Benedict describes two main kinds of cultural
              differences. The first kind is where people we have
              labeled "abnormal" and unfit have a respected, though not
              necessarily central, place in other societies (Benedict,
              1-2). Explain one of Benedict's examples of that kind of
              difference.<br>
              <br>
              9. Benedict says, "The most spectacular illustrations of
              the extent to which normality may be culturally defined
              are those cultures where an abnormality of our culture is
              the cornerstone of their social structure" (3). First,
              explain what this sentence means. Then, pick one of the
              cultures she uses to illustrate this point (3-4), and
              explain how that culture's practices are supposed to
              support Benedict's claim.<br>
              <br>
              10. Explain how Benedict uses her examples of difference
              to support cultural relativism. In class, this was
              summarized in "Benedict's argument"; state that 4-step
              argument.<br>
              <br>
              11. State the "Cultural Differences Argument" (Rachels,
              3). Why does Rachels think it is bad (3-4)? Why does his
              rejection of it nevertheless fail as an attack on
              Benedict's view (Phil 230, 2024-08-28)?<br>
              <br>
              12. Rachels says, &#8220;There are some moral rules that all
              societies must have in common, because those rules are
              necessary for society to exist&#8221; (7). Explain the examples
              he uses to support this claim.<br>
              <br>
              13. King describes how Black Americans were treated under
              segregation (King, 14). What would a moral skeptic say
              about whether that treatment was wrong? What would a moral
              subjectivist say? A cultural relativist (remember this one
              is tricky)?<br>
              <br>
              14. King says (15) that we should obey just laws but
              disobey unjust laws. How does King believe we can
              objectively distinguish just laws from unjust laws (King,
              16)? (Discussing King's examples from paragraphs 17-19 may
              be helpful, but it is most important to explain what he
              says in paragraph 16.)<br>
              <br>
              15. In class we raised several worries about Rachels
              (specifically, his claim that some rules are justified
              because society cannot exist without them, 7; Phil 230,
              2024-08-28) and about King's claims re how we can
              objectively distinguish just laws from unjust laws (King,
              16; Phil 230, 2024-08-30). Explain one of our worries
              about Rachels, and one of our worries about King. <br>
              <br>
              16. Aquinas argues for ethical objectivism by saying that
              human nature -- specifically, our natural "inclinations"
              -- provide an objective basis for judging human laws. What
              inclinations does Aquinas identify (<span
                style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>, 4-5; Aquinas
              explainer video; Aquinas chart)? What "precepts of natural
              law" does Aquinas derive from these inclinations?<br>
              <br>
              17. What does it mean to say that the precepts of natural
              law are <span style="font-style: italic;">vague</span>,
              and that they are <span style="font-style: italic;">authoritative</span>?
              What are the implications of them being vague, and of them
              being authoritative? Give an example to illustrate how the

              and Beth disagree. Adara is a conservative Saudi Muslim.
              Adara criticizes Beth for dressing immodestly because Beth
              does not cover her face or legs in public. Beth is an
              American liberal atheist. Beth criticizes Adara for
              wanting to restrict women&#8217;s freedom by dictating how they

                how Aquinas might try to resolve the dispute between
                Adara and Beth. In other words, given what Aquinas says
                in the assigned reading, is there any prospect of
                resolving their dispute? What might it be? (What&#8217;s most
                important here is to give a sense of how Aquinas would
                approach this matter. The more thoroughly you can answer
                the other Aquinas questions, the better you will be able
                to explain that.)<br>

              <br>
              20. Glaucon describes "what justice is like and what its
              origins are" (Plato, 37-8). What four claims about human
              nature does he make there (or, rather, what four claims
              does he think most people believe)?<br>
              <br>
              21. Suppose Glaucon's four claims about human nature are
              true. What, then, does Glaucon think we should do (Plato,
              37)? What, then, is Glaucon implying about us &amp;
              society?<br>
              <br>
              22. In class we discussed what people would do if they had
              a ring that would enable them to do as they please. What
              were the results -- would people generally behave justly
              or not? How does that relate to Glaucon's claims about
              human nature?<br>

            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">23. What four things must
              all consequentialist ethical theories do? Why, then, can
              there be many different consequentialist theories? In your
              answer, be sure to identify the different possible kinds
              of accounts of the good, and at least three possible
              scopes.<br>
              <br>
              24. How does classical utilitarianism (CU) do the four
              things consequentialist theories do? Why does Bentham
              think CU's account of the good is correct (Bentham, 1)?<br>
              <br>
              25. State the Principle of Utility, either from class or
              from Bentham's or Mill&#8217;s text (Bentham, 1; Mill calls it
              the &#8220;Greatest Happiness Principle,&#8221; 1). What steps should
              you take to apply the PU properly? (Bentham's description
              in section V on pp. 3-4 may be helpful here.)<br>
              <br>
              26. Explain why classical utilitarianism has the
              "accounting problem" we discussed in class. How does
              Bentham respond to the problem (Bentham, 4, section VI)?<br>
              <br>
              27. How does Bentham think we should rank pleasures? Take
              two very different activities (maybe, eating Cheetos or
              watching a film like <span style="font-style: italic;">Parasite</span>)
              and explain how Bentham's scheme might rank them, using
              the factors he mentions (Bentham, 3). (Well, you don't
              have to use all; let's say, use four of them). Which of
              your two activities would be better, according to
              Bentham's scheme, and why?<br>
              <br>
              28. What is the "swine problem"? In other words, why has
              utilitarianism been accused of being "a doctrine worthy
              only of swine" (Mill, 1)?<br>
              <br>

              Mill's response to utilitarianism's swine problem. In
              doing so, be sure to answer the following questions. What
              are the pleasures Mill says that only humans can enjoy
              (Mill, 1)? How does he try to show that we value them much
              more highly (Mill, 2)? If Mill were right, how might that
              solve the swine problem? Finally, in class we noted a
              problem -- the "snob problem" -- with Mill's response to
              the swine problem. What was it?<br>
              <br>
              30. Explain Mill's response to utilitarianism's
              "accounting problem." What does he say most of us may do,
              most of the time? How does Mill argue that some people
              have more responsibility than others (Mill, 5)? (In class
              this was compared to the <target="_blank"

                  href="Spider-Man_Rule.jpg">Spider-Man Rule</a>.)
                Finally, what concerns were raised in class about Mill's
                solution? <br>
                <br>
                31. Nozick gives three reasons why, he says, we would
                not plug in to the Experience Machine (Nozick, 43-4).
                What are they? If Nozick is right that we would not plug
                in to the Experience Machine <span style="font-style:
                  italic;">and </span>he is right about why we would
                not, how would that suggest a serious problem with
                classical utilitarianism? (The argument from the
                explainer video or the one given in class 2024-09-18
                will be useful here.)<br>
                <br>
                32. Explain why utilitarianism would say that, in Le
                Guin&#8217;s imaginary city of Omelas, it is morally right for
                the citizens to persecute the child. Why does this make
                utilitarianism objectionable?<br>
                <br>
                33. What is the "moral conservative" objection to
                consequentialism (Nielsen, 219)? What is Nielsen's
                strategy for countering this objection (Phil 230,
                2024-09-20)?<br>

                conservatives have used magistrate-type cases to object
                to consequentialism, saying consequentialism requires
                deliberately harming the innocent. How does Nielsen
                argue that moral conservatives need not object to
                consequentialism for how it deals with the magistrate
                case (223-5)? (Be sure to discuss what he says could
                happen if word gets out, 224.) How satisfactory is
                Nielsen's argument here? Give the strongest reasons you
                can to agree with you.<br>

                <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">35. </span>Nielsen





                says consequentialism may clearly require harming the
                innocent sometimes -- for example, in the case of the
                fat man stuck in the cave mouth (Nielsen, 222). How does
                he argue that this is the right thing to do here
                (228-30)? (Your answer will be better if you discuss how
                Nielsen responds to concerns about callousness, using
                the fat man as a means, and/or inhumanity, 228-30.) How
                satisfactory is his argument regarding this case? Give
                the strongest reasons you can to agree with you.<br>
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Advice: </span>some
                exam questions, like #36 and 37, ask you to give your
                opinion and your reasons for it. The best strategy is
                to:<br>
                <ul>
                  <li>First, before giving your opinion, explain what
                    the author says in as much detail as you can. That
                    will give you things to think critically about. You
                    might agree with part of it but disagree with
                    another part, for example. <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Second, when giving your opinion, give independent
                    reasons; <span style="font-style: italic;">don't
                      just echo the author's own reasons</span>. For
                    example, saying "I agree with Nielsen in the fat man
                    case because blowing the fat man up is the lesser
                    evil" does not demonstrate any thought on your part.
                    If you can't say much more than that, I suggest
                    answering a different question.</li>
                </ul>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
              36. Define the following terms as they are used in this
              course: &#8220;act utilitarianism,&#8221; &#8220;rule utilitarianism&#8221;
              (Hospers, 4, 10; class notes).<br>
              <br>
              37. Hospers presents several cases at the beginning of his
              article: a student seeking an undeserved grade; a thief
              seeking to be released; a district attorney considering
              whether to keep an innocent man in jail; and voting
              (Hospers, 1-2, 3-4). Pick just one of these cases, and
              explain why act-utilitarianism would recommend one choice
              while rule-utilitarianism would recommend a different
              choice in that case.<br>
              <br>
              38. According to Hospers, what is wrong with having simple
              rules such as &#8220;do not lie&#8221; or &#8220;do not kill&#8221; (Hospers, 8-9,
              10)? Why does he think it would also be bad to have rules
              like this: &#8220;do not ____, except where it will do the most
              good&#8221; (11-2)? What sort of rules does Hospers think we
              should have (9)?<br>
