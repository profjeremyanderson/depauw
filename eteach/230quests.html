            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">All exams will consist of
              some of these questions.<br>
              <br>
              Questions that appear on the mid-term exam will be struck
              out <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">so they
                look like this</span> and will not be used again. Any

              When new exam questions are posted here (roughly weekly),

              As noted on the syllabus, I offer several kinds of help
              for you to give good answers:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>Citations in exam questions point you to material
                  needed for giving good answers. Use them.</li>
                <li>The <a

                    Answers web page</a> has answers to some exam
                  questions and advice on how to write better answers.</li>
                <li>Some notes and exercises from class will be <a

                    on Moodle</a>. These will be helpful for answering
                  some exam questions. Also, if class is taught
                  remotely, sessions will be recorded and the recordings
                  will be there, too.</li>
                <li>You may <a href="230home.html#contact">email</a> me
                  your answers to up to three exam questions per week
                  and I will help you improve them</li>
                <li>We can discuss your answers <a
                    href="230home.html#contact">during office hours or
                    by appointment</a>. You may also form study groups
                  -- in fact, I encourage you to.</li>
                <li>There will be review sessions before each exam. See

              </ul>
              The best way to prepare is to keep up each week. When new
              questions are added, use the texts and notes (and
              classmates -- group study is helpful) to remind yourself
              of the relevant material, write out the best answers you
              can, and study them periodically.<br>

                questions about Ethical Theory (our first day)</span></font><br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. In class we listed many
              reasons why one should, or should not, hook up with a
              stranger when their significant other is away. These
              reasons fell into three main groups. Identify the three
              groups and, for each one, identify one of the reasons in
              that group. Name the type of ethical theory which
              corresponds to each group.<br>
              <br>
            </div>
            <br>
            <a name="basis_of_rules"></a><br>
            <font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exam
                questions about the basis of moral rules</span></font><br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">2. Cephalus believes that
              justice is being truthful and giving back what you have
              taken from another (Plato, 5). Why does Socrates reject
              this definition?<br>
              <br>
              3. In class we saw that Cephalus, Socrates, and
              Polemarchus hold what we called conventional assumptions
              about justice (Plato, 5-14 <span style="font-style:
                italic;">passim</span>; Phil 230, 2022-08-26). What are
              these assumptions?<br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 4. Explain
                what Thrasymachus means when he says that &#8220;justice is
                nothing other than what is advantageous for the
                stronger&#8221; (Plato, 15; Phil 230, 2022-08-26). How does
                this challenge conventional assumptions about justice?</span><br>
              <br>
              5. Thrasymachus defends his moral skepticism by arguing
              that being just does not benefit you--rather, it is bad
              for you--and that "justice" is really a sort of scam used
              to exploit the weak. What evidence does Thrasymachus give
              for this (Plato, 15-22, especially 21-22)?<br>
              <br>
              6. Define these terms as they are used in this course:
              &#8220;moral skepticism,&#8221; &#8220;moral subjectivism,&#8221; &#8220;cultural
              relativism,&#8221; and &#8220;ethical objectivism&#8221; (Phil 230,
              2022-08-29).<br>
              <br>
              7. Benedict describes two main kinds of cultural
              differences. One kind is where people we have labeled
              "abnormal" and unfit have a respected (though not
              necessarily central) place in other societies (Benedict,
              1-2). Explain one of Benedict's examples of that kind of
              difference.<br>
              <br>
              8. Benedict says, "The most spectacular illustrations of
              the extent to which normality may be culturally defined
              are those cultures where an abnormality of our culture is
              the cornerstone of their social structure" (3). First,
              explain what this sentence means. Then, pick one of the
              cultures she uses to illustrate this point (3-4), and
              explain how that culture's practices are supposed to
              support Benedict's claim.<br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 9. Explain
                how Benedict uses her examples of differences to support
                cultural relativism. In class, this was summarized in
                "Benedict's argument"; state that argument. </span><br>
              <br>
              10. State the "Cultural Differences Argument" (Rachels,
              3). Why does Rachels think it is bad (3-4)?<br>
              <br>
              11. Rachels says, &#8220;There are some moral rules that all
              societies must have in common, because those rules are
              necessary for society to exist&#8221; (7). Explain the examples
              he uses to support this claim.<br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 12.
                According to Rachels, there is a culture-neutral
                standard for telling whether moral rules are justified
                (Rachels, 9). What is it?</span><br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 13. King
                describes how Black Americans were treated under
                segregation (King, 14). What would a moral skeptic say
                about whether that treatment was wrong? What would a
                moral subjectivist say? A cultural relativist (remember
                this one is tricky)?</span><br>
              <br>
              14. King says we should obey just laws but disobey unjust
              laws (15). How does King believe we can we objectively
              distinguish just laws from unjust laws (King, 16)?
              (Discussing King's examples from paragraphs 17-19 may be
              helpful, but it is most important to explain what he says
              in paragraph 16.)<br>
              <br>
              15. Benedict observes individual cultures and finds
              differences among them. How does Aquinas differ? (Class
              notes and the Aquinas explainer video will be helpful
              here.)<br>
              <br>
              16. Aquinas argues for ethical objectivism by saying that
              human nature -- specifically, our natural inclinations --
              provide an objective basis for judging human laws. What
              are the inclinations Aquinas identifies (<span
                style="font-style: italic;">Summa</span>, 4-5; Aquinas
              explainer video, Aquinas chart)? What precepts of natural
              law does Aquinas derive from these inclinations?<br>
              <br>
              17. What does it mean to say that the precepts of natural
              law are <span style="font-style: italic;">vague</span>,
              and that they are <span style="font-style: italic;">authoritative</span>?
              What are the implications of them being vague, and being
              authoritative? Give an example to illustrate how the
              precepts might be used to criticize a society's law.
              (Class notes and the Aquinas explainer video and chart
              will be helpful here.)<br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Situation: </span>Adara
              and Beth disagree. Adara is a conservative Saudi Muslim.
              Adara criticizes Beth for dressing immodestly because Beth
              does not cover her face or legs in public. Beth is an
              American liberal atheist. Beth criticizes Adara for
              wanting to restrict women&#8217;s freedom by dictating how they

              20. Glaucon describes "what justice is like and what its
              origins are" (Plato, 37-8). What four claims about human
              nature does he make there (or, rather, what four claims
              does he think "the many" believe)?<br>

              four claims about human nature are true. What, then, does
              Glaucon think we should do (Plato, 37)? What, then, is
              Glaucon implying about us &amp; society?<br>
              <br>
              22. In class we discussed what people would do if they had
              a ring that would enable them to do as they please. What
              were the results -- would people generally behave justly
              or not? How does that relate to Glaucon's claims about
              human nature?<br>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">23. What four things must
              all consequentialist ethical theories do? Why, then, can
              there be many different consequentialist theories? In your
              answer, be sure to identify the different possible kinds
              of accounts of the good, and at least three possible
              scopes.<br>
              <br>
              24. How does classical utilitarianism (CU) do the four
              things consequentialist theories do? Why does Bentham
              think CU's account of the good is correct?<br>
              <br>
              25. State the Principle of Utility, either from class or
              from Bentham's or Mill&#8217;s text (Bentham, 1; Mill calls it
              the &#8220;Greatest Happiness Principle,&#8221; 1). What steps should
              you take to apply the PU properly? (Bentham's description
              in section V on pp. 3-4 may be helpful here.)<br>
              <br>
              26. Explain why classical utilitarianism has the
              "accounting problem" we discussed in class. How does
              Bentham respond to the problem (Bentham, 4, section VI)?<br>
              <br>
              27. Why does classical utilitarianism need a principled
              way rank pleasures?<br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 28. How does

                Bentham's scheme might rank them, using the parameters
                he mentions (Bentham, 3). (Well, you don't have to use
                all; let's say, use four of them). Which of your two
                activities would be better, according to Bentham's
                scheme, and why?</span><br>

              29. What is the "swine problem"? In other words, why has
              utilitarianism been accused of being "a doctrine worthy
              only of swine" (Mill, 1)? (Remember Mother Teresa and the
              Rolling Stones.)<br>

              Mill's response to utilitarianism's swine problem. In
              doing so, be sure to answer the following questions. What
              are the pleasures Mill says that only humans can enjoy
              (Mill, 1)? How does he argue that we value them much more
              highly (Mill, 2)? If Mill were right, how might that solve
              the swine problem? Finally, in class we noted some
              problems with Mill's response to the swine problem. What
              were they?<br>
              <br>
              31. Explain Mill's response to utilitarianism's
              "accounting problem." How does Mill argue that some people
              have more responsibility than others (Mill, 5)? (In class
              this was compared to the Spider-Man Rule.) <br>
              <br>
              32. Nozick gives three reasons why, he says, we would not
              plug in to the Experience Machine (Nozick, 43-4). What are
              they?<br>
              <br>
              33. If Nozick is right that we would not plug in to the
              Experience Machine <span style="font-style: italic;">and
              </span>he is right about why we would not, how would that
              show a serious problem with classical
              utilitarianism?&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              34. Explain why utilitarianism would conclude that, in Le
              Guin&#8217;s imaginary city of Omelas, it is morally right for
              the citizens to persecute the child. Why does this make
              utilitarianism objectionable?<br>
              <br>
              35. What is the "moral conservative" objection to
              consequentialism (Nielsen, 219; class notes)? What is
              Nielsen's strategy for countering this objection?<br>

              <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">36. </span>Moral
















              conservatives have used magistrate-type cases to argue
              that consequentialism should be rejected because it
              requires deliberately harming the innocent. How does
              Nielsen argue that moral conservatives need not reject
              consequentialism for how it deals with the magistrate case
              (223-5)? (Be sure to discuss what he says could happen if
              word gets out, 224.) How satisfactory is Nielsen's

              with you.<br>

                style="text-decoration: line-through;">Nielsen says
                consequentialism may clearly require harming the
                innocent sometimes -- for example, in the case of the
                fat man stuck in the cave mouth (Nielsen, 222). How does
                he argue that this is the right thing to do here
                (228-30)? (Your answer will be better if you include how
                Nielsen responds to concerns about callousness, using
                the fat man as a means, and inhumanity, 228-30.) How
                satisfactory is his argument regarding this case? Give
                the strongest reasons you can to agree with you.</span><br>
              <br>
              Advice: some exam questions, like #39 and 40, ask you to
              give your opinion and your reasons for it. The best
              strategy is to -- first, before giving your opinion --
              explain what the author says in as much detail as you can.
              That will give you things to think critically about. You
              might agree with part of it, and disagree with another
              part, for example. Second, when giving your opinion, try
              to give independent reasons, don't just echo the author's
              own reasons. For example, saying "I agree with Nielsen in
              the fat man case because blowing the fat man up is the
              lesser evil" does not show much thought on your part. If
              you can't say much more than that, I recommend answering
              different question.<br>
              <br>
              38. Define the following terms as they are used in this
              course: &#8220;act utilitarianism,&#8221; &#8220;rule utilitarianism&#8221;
              (Hospers, 4, 10; class notes).<br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 39. Hospers
                presents several cases at the beginning of his article:
                a student seeking an undeserved grade; a thief seeking
                to be released; a district attorney considering whether
                to keep an innocent man in jail; and voting (Hospers,
                1-2, 3-4). Pick one of these cases, and explain why
                act-utilitarianism would recommend one choice while
                rule-utilitarianism would recommend a different choice.</span><br>
              <br>
              40. What is "negative responsibility" (Williams, 2)? (He
              calls it "negative responsibility" or the "strong doctrine
              of negative responsibility.") Suppose Jim decides not to
              shoot one Indian when Pedro invites him to (cf. Williams,
              3-4). According to consequentialism, how responsible is
              Jim when Pedro orders twenty Indians shot?<br>
              <br>
              41. According to Williams, what does utilitarianism say
              George should do about that job offer from the weapons lab
              (Williams, 3-4)? Why does Williams believe utilitarianism
              is wrong about that (2-3, 4-9)? (Yes this is challenging.
              Ideally your answer will involve the notions that Williams
              thinks are important in this case: negative responsibility
              (2-3), the impact of other people&#8217;s decisions on our
              projects and happiness (4-7), and integrity (7-9).)<br>
              <br>
              42. How do we normally think about giving money to help
              needy people? Why does Singer say we are mistaken (235)? <br>
              <br>
              43. Singer states a moral principle, but gives two
              versions of it: a "strong" one and a "moderate" one
              (Singer, 231). What is the "strong" one? How is it more
              demanding (requires more sacrifice) than the "moderate"
              one?<br>
              <br>
              44. What is Singer's "moderate" principle (Singer, 231)?
              Why does he think it implies we should do much more to aid
              needy people around the world than we currently do
              (235-6)? <br>
              <br>
              45. Among Harwood&#8217;s eleven objections to utilitarianism
              are that it fails to take promises seriously enough (#4;
              Harwood, 6-7); it overstates our duties to animals (#8;
              Harwood, 11); and that it panders to bigots and sadists
              (#9; Harwood, 11-2). Pick <span style="font-style:
                italic;">one </span>of these objections and explain it.
              That is, put the objection in your own words and make
              clear how it is supposed to give us a reason to reject
              utilitarianism.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              46. Harrison and Harwood (in Harwood, 9-10) object to rule
              utilitarianism (RU) on several grounds. In class, they
              were combined into a dilemma: either (a) RU always says to
              do the same thing as act utilitarianism, or (b) at least
              sometimes RU does not, but RU is objectionable either way.
              Explain this dilemma, being sure to make clear why both
              (a) and (b) are supposed to be problems for RU.<br>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">47. Lecture discussed three
              types of <span style="font-style: italic;">deontological

              we are supposed to know what is right and wrong. Identify
              and define these three types. Of these three, which type
              is Kant's theory?<br>
              <br>
              48. Kant says this about the nature of moral laws and the
              proper sort of justification for them:<br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">That there must be [a
                &#8220;pure&#8221; moral] philosophy is evident from the common idea
                of duty and of moral laws. Everyone must admit that if a
                law is to be morally valid, i.e., is to be valid as a
                ground of obligation, then it must carry with it
                absolute necessity. He must admit that the command,
                &#8220;Thou shalt not lie,&#8221; does not hold only for men, as if
                other rational beings had no need to abide by it, and so
                with all the other moral laws properly so called. And he
                must concede that the ground of obligation here must
                therefore be sought not in the world in which man is
                placed, but must be sought...solely in the concepts of
                pure reason.... (Kant, 1).<br>
              </div>
              <br>
              Without using Kant's words, explain how Kant argues here
              that the justification of moral laws must come from pure
              reason.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              49. What does Kant mean by "rational being"? Why are
              rational beings <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span>necessarily
              human? Why are some human beings not rational beings?<br>
              <br>
              50. Given Kant's commitment to justifying moral laws by
              pure reason, explain why Kant would reject some other
              views we have looked at in the course. Pick <span

              &amp; Mill's classical utilitarianism. Identify specific
