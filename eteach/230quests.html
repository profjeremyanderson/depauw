            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">All exams will consist of
              some of these questions.<br>
              <br>
              Questions that appeared on a previous exam will be struck
              out <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">so they
                look like this</span> and will not be used again. Any

              When new exam questions are posted here (roughly weekly),
              I will email you via Moodle. If you don't receive

              As noted on the syllabus, I offer several kinds of help
              for you to give good answers:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>Citations in exam questions point you to material
                  needed for giving good answers. Use them.</li>
                <li>The <a href="230samples.html">Sample Answers web
                    page</a> has answers to some exam questions and
                  advice on how to write better answers.</li>
                <li>Some notes and exercises from class will be <a
                    target="_blank"
                    href="https://moodle.depauw.edu/course/view.php?id=18397#section-4">posted






                    on Moodle</a>. These will be helpful for answering
                  some exam questions. Also, if class is taught
                  remotely, sessions will be recorded and the recordings
                  will be there, too.</li>
                <li>You may <a href="230home.html#contact">email</a> me
                  your answers to up to three exam questions per week
                  and I will help you improve them</li>
                <li>We can discuss your answers <a
                    href="230home.html#contact">during office hours or
                    by appointment</a>. You may also form study groups
                  -- in fact, I encourage you to.</li>
                <li>There will be review sessions before each exam. See
                  the <a target="_blank"

                    schedule Google doc</a>.</li>
              </ul>
              The best way to prepare is to keep up each week. When new
              questions are added, use the texts and notes (and
              classmates -- group study is helpful) to remind yourself
              of the relevant material, write out the best answers you
              can, and study them periodically.<br>

                questions about Ethical Theory (our first day)</span></font><br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. In class we listed many
              reasons why one should, or should not, hook up with a
              stranger when their significant other is away. These
              reasons fell into three main groups. Identify the three
              groups and, for each one, identify one of the reasons in
              that group. Then name the type of ethical theory which
              corresponds to each group.<br>
            </div>
            <br>
            <a name="basis_of_rules"></a><br>
            <font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exam
                questions about the basis of moral rules</span></font><br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">2. Cephalus believes that
              justice is being truthful and giving back what you have
              taken from another (Plato, 5). Why does Socrates reject
              this definition?<br>
              <br>
              3. In class we saw that Cephalus, Socrates, and
              Polemarchus hold what we called conventional assumptions
              about justice (Plato, 5-14 <span style="font-style:
                italic;">passim</span>; Phil 230, 2022-02-02). What are
              these assumptions?<br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 4. Explain
                what Thrasymachus means when he says that &#8220;justice is
                nothing other than what is advantageous for the
                stronger&#8221; (Plato, 15; Phil 230, 2022-02-02). How does
                this challenge conventional assumptions about justice?</span><br>
              <br>
              5. Thrasymachus defends his moral skepticism by arguing
              that being just does not benefit you--rather, it is bad
              for you--and that "justice" is really a sort of scam used
              to exploit the weak. How does he argue for this? In other
              words, what reasons does he give for his view (Plato,
              15-22, especially 21-22)?<br>
              <br>
              6. Define these terms as they are used in this course:
              &#8220;moral skepticism,&#8221; &#8220;moral subjectivism,&#8221; &#8220;cultural
              relativism,&#8221; and &#8220;ethical objectivism&#8221; (Phil 230,
              2022-02-04).<br>
              <br>
              7. Benedict describes two main kinds of cultural
              differences. One kind is where people we have labeled
              "abnormal" and unfit--such as those who are cataleptic or
              homosexual--have a respected (though not necessarily
              central) place in other societies (Benedict, 1-2). Explain
              one of Benedict's examples of that kind of difference.<br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 8. Benedict
                says, "The most spectacular illustrations of the extent
                to which normality may be culturally defined are those
                cultures where an abnormality of our culture is the
                cornerstone of their social structure" (3). First,
                explain what this sentence means. Then, pick one of the
                cultures she uses to illustrate this point, and explain
                how that culture's practices are supposed to support
                Benedict's claim.</span><br>
              <br>
              9. Explain how Benedict uses her examples of differences
              to support cultural relativism. In class, this was
              summarized in "Benedict's argument"; explain that
              argument.<br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 10. Rachels
                says, &#8220;There are some moral rules that all societies
                must have in common, because those rules are necessary
                for society to exist&#8221; (7). How does he support this
                claim?</span><br>
              <br>
              11. According to Rachels, there is a culture-neutral
              standard for telling whether moral rules are justified
              (Rachels, 9). What is it? <br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 12. King
                describes how Black Americans were treated under
                segregation (King, 14). What would a moral skeptic say
                about whether that treatment was wrong? What would a
                moral subjectivist say? A cultural relativist?</span><br>
              <br>
              13. King says we should obey just laws but disobey unjust
              laws (15). How does King believe we can we objectively
              distinguish just laws from unjust laws (King, 16)?
              (Discussing King's examples from paragraphs 17-19 may be
              helpful, but it is most important to explain what he says
              in paragraph 16.)<br>
              <br>
              14. Benedict observes individual cultures and finds
              differences among them. How does Aquinas differ? (Class
              notes and the Aquinas explainer video will be helpful
              here.)<br>
              <br>
              15. Aquinas argues for ethical objectivism by saying that
              human nature -- specifically, our natural inclinations --
              provide an objective basis for judging human laws. What
              are the inclinations Aquinas identifies (Summa, 4-5;
              Aquinas explainer video)? What precepts of natural law
              does Aquinas derive from these inclinations?<br>
              <br>
              16. What does it mean to say that the precepts of natural
              law are <span style="font-style: italic;">vague</span>,
              and that they are <span style="font-style: italic;">authoritative</span>?
              What are the implications of them being vague, and being
              authoritative? Give an example to illustrate how the
              precepts might be used to criticize a society's law.
              (Class notes and the Aquinas explainer video will be
              helpful here.)<br>

              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Situation: </span>Adara
              and Beth disagree. Adara is a conservative Saudi Muslim.
              Adara criticizes Beth for dressing immodestly because Beth
              does not cover her face or legs in public. Beth is an
              American liberal atheist. Beth criticizes Adara for
              wanting to restrict women&#8217;s freedom by dictating how they
              dress.<br>

                  Aquinas might resolve the dispute between Adara and
                  Beth. In other words, given what Aquinas says in the
                  assigned reading, is there any prospect of resolving
                  their dispute? What might it be? (What&#8217;s most
                  important here is to give a sense of how Aquinas would
                  approach this matter. The more thoroughly you can
                  answer the other Aquinas questions, the better you
                  will be able to explain that.)</span><br>

                and Socrates agree there are three ways something can be
                good (Plato, 36). Explain what each is, and give two
                examples of each. (You may use examples from the book or
                class discussion, but you will get more points if you

              19. Glaucon describes "what justice is like and what its
              origins are" (Plato, 37-8). What four claims about human
              nature does he make there (or, rather, what four claims
              does he think "the many" believe)?<br>

              20. <span style="font-style: italic;">Suppose </span>Glaucon's






              four claims about human nature are true. What, then, does
              Glaucon think we should do (Plato, 37)? What, then, is
              Glaucon implying about us &amp; society?<br>
              <br>
              21. In class we discussed what people would do if they had
              a ring that would enable them to do as they please. What
              were the results -- would people generally behave justly
              or not? How does that relate to Glaucon's claims about
              human nature?<br>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">22. What four things must
              all consequentialist ethical theories do? Why, then, can
              there be many different consequentialist theories? In your
              answer, be sure to identify the different possible kinds
              of accounts of the good, and at least three possible
              scopes.<br>
              <br>
              23. How does classical utilitarianism (CU) do the four
              things consequentialist theories do? Why does Bentham
              think CU's account of the good is correct?<br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 24. State
                the Principle of Utility, either from class or from
                Bentham's or Mill&#8217;s text (Bentham, 1; Mill calls it the
                &#8220;Greatest Happiness Principle,&#8221; 1). What steps should
                you take to apply the PU properly? (Bentham's
                description in section V on pp. 3-4 may be helpful
                here.)</span><br>
              <br>
              25. Explain why classical utilitarianism has the
              "accounting problem" we discussed in class. How does
              Bentham respond to the problem (Bentham, 4, section VI)?<br>
              <br>
              26. Why does classical utilitarianism need a principled
              way rank pleasures?<br>
              <br>
              27. How does Bentham think we should rank pleasures? Take
              two very different activities (maybe, eating <a
                target="_blank" href="https://www.cheetos.com/">Cheetos</a>
              or watching a film like <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/"><span
                  style="font-style: italic;">Parasite</span></a>) and
              explain how Bentham's scheme might rank them, using the
              parameters he mentions (Bentham, 3). (Well, you don't have
              to use all; let's say, use four of them). Which of your
              two activities would be better, according to Bentham's
              scheme, and why?<br>
              <br>
              28. What is the "swine problem"? In other words, why has
              utilitarianism been accused of being "a doctrine worthy
              only of swine" (Mill, 1)? (Remember Mother Teresa and the
              Rolling Stones.)<br>
              <br>
              <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">29. </span>Mill






              responds to the swine problem in two ways. Explain both of
              them. In doing so, be sure to answer the following
              questions. What are the pleasures Mill says that only
              humans can enjoy (Mill, 1)? How does he argue that we
              value them much more highly (Mill, 2)? What does Mill say
              are the causes of unhappiness in those who are well off,
              and those who are not (Mill, 4)? How does Mill think a
              life of self-development and service alleviates
              unhappiness for everyone, well off or not (Mill, 4-5)?<br>
              <br>
              30. In class we noted some problems with Mill's responses
              to the "swine problem." What were they?<br>
              <br>
              31. Explain Mill's response to the "accounting problem."
              How does Mill argue that some people have more
              responsibility than others (Mill, 5)? (In class this was
              compared to the Spider-Man Rule.) <br>
              <br>
              32. Nozick gives three reasons why, he says, we would not
              plug in to the Experience Machine (Nozick, 43-4). What are
              they?<br>
              <br>
              33. If Nozick is right that we would not plug in to the
              Experience Machine <span style="font-style: italic;">and
              </span>he is right about why we would not, how would that
              show a serious problem with classical
              utilitarianism?&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              34. Explain why utilitarianism would conclude that, in Le
              Guin&#8217;s imaginary city of Omelas, it is morally right for
              the citizens to persecute the child. Why does this make
              utilitarianism objectionable?<br>
              <br>
              35. What is the "moral conservative" objection to
              consequentialism (Nielsen, 219; class notes)? What is
              Nielsen's strategy for countering this objection?<br>
              <br>
              <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">36. </span>Moral






              conservatives have used magistrate-type cases to argue
              that consequentialism should be rejected because it
              requires deliberately harming the innocent. How does
              Nielsen argue that moral conservatives need not reject
              consequentialism for how it deals with the magistrate case
              (223-5)? (Be sure to discuss what he says could happen if
              word gets out, 224.) How satisfactory is Nielsen's
              argument here? Give the strongest reasons you can to agree
              with you.<br>
              <br>
              <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">37. </span>Nielsen






              says consequentialism may clearly require harming the
              innocent sometimes -- for example, in the case of the fat
              man stuck in the cave mouth (Nielsen, 222). How does he
              argue that this is the right thing to do here (228-30)?
              (Your answer will be better if you include how Nielsen
              responds to concerns about callousness, using the fat man
              as a means, and inhumanity, 228-30.) How satisfactory is
              his argument regarding this case? Give the strongest
              reasons you can to agree with you.<br>
              <br>
              Advice: some exam questions, like #39 and 40, ask you to
              give your opinion and your reasons for it. The best
              strategy is to -- first, before giving your opinion --
              explain what the author says in as much detail as you can.
              That will give you things to think critically about. You
              might agree with part of it, and disagree with another
              part, for example. Second, when giving your opinion, it's
              better to give independent reasons; don't just echo the
              author's own reasons. For example, saying "I agree with
              Nielsen in the fat man case because blowing the fat man up
              is the lesser evil" does not show much thought on your
              part. If you can't say much more than that, I recommend
              answering different question.<br>
              <br>
              38. Define the following terms as they are used in this
              course: &#8220;act utilitarianism,&#8221; &#8220;rule utilitarianism&#8221;
              (Hospers, 4, 10; class notes).<br>
              <br>
              <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 39. Hospers
                presents several cases at the beginning of his article:
                a student seeking an undeserved grade; a thief seeking
                to be released; a district attorney considering whether
                to keep an innocent man in jail; and voting (Hospers,
                1-2, 3-4). Pick one of these cases, and explain why
                act-utilitarianism would recommend one choice while
                rule-utilitarianism would recommend a different choice.</span><br>
              <br>
              40. According to Hospers, what is wrong with having simple
              rules such as &#8220;do not lie&#8221; or &#8220;do not kill&#8221; (Hospers, 8-9,
              10)? Why does he think it would be a bad idea to have
              rules like this: &#8220;do not kill, except where killing will
              do the most good&#8221; (11-2)? So what sort of rules does
              Hospers think we should have (9)?<br>
              <br>
              41. What is "negative responsibility" (Williams, 2)? (He
              calls it "negative responsibility" or the "strong doctrine
              of negative responsibility.") Suppose Jim decides not to
              shoot one Indian when Pedro invites him to (cf. Williams,
              3-4). According to consequentialism, how responsible is
              Jim when Pedro has twenty Indians shot?<br>
              <br>
              <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);

                style="text-decoration: line-through;">According to
                Williams, what does utilitarianism say George should do
                about that job offer from the weapons lab (Williams,
                3-4)? Why does Williams believe utilitarianism is wrong
                about that (2-3, 4-9)? (Yes this is challenging. Ideally
                your answer will involve the notions that Williams
                thinks are important in this case: negative
                responsibility (2-3), the impact of other people&#8217;s
                decisions on our projects and happiness (4-7), and
                integrity (7-9).)</span><br>
              <br>
              43. Singer states a moral principle, but gives two
              versions of it: a "strong" one and a "moderate" one
              (Singer, 231). What is the "strong" one? How is it more
              demanding (requires more sacrifice) than the "moderate"
              one?<br>
              <br>
              44. What is Singer's "moderate" principle (Singer, 231)?
              Why does he think it implies we should do much more to aid
              needy people around the world (235-6)? What effects does
              he think it would have, if we followed it (241-2)?<br>
              <br>
              45. Among Harwood&#8217;s eleven objections to utilitarianism
              are that it fails to take promises seriously enough (#4;
              Harwood, 6-7); it overstates our duties to animals (#8;
              Harwood, 11); and that it panders to bigots and sadists
              (#9; Harwood, 11-2). Pick <span style="font-style:
                italic;">one </span>of these objections and explain it.
              That is, put the objection in your own words and make
              clear how it is supposed to give us a reason to reject
              utilitarianism.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              46. Harrison and Harwood (in Harwood, 9-10) object to rule
              utilitarianism (RU) on several grounds. In class, they
              were combined into a dilemma: either (a) RU always says to
              do the same thing as act utilitarianism, or (b) at least
              sometimes RU does not--but that RU is objectionable either
              way. Explain this dilemma, being sure to make clear why
              both (a) and (b) are supposed to be problems for RU.<br>

            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">47. Lecture discussed three
              types of <span style="font-style: italic;">deontological
              </span>ethical theories, which were distinguished by how
              we are supposed to know what is right and wrong. Identify
              and define these three types. Of these three, which type
              is Kant's theory?<br>
              <br>
              48. Kant says this about the nature of moral laws and the
              proper sort of justification for them:<br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">That there must be [a
                &#8220;pure&#8221; moral] philosophy is evident from the common idea
                of duty and of moral laws. Everyone must admit that if a
                law is to be morally valid, i.e., is to be valid as a
                ground of obligation, then it must carry with it
                absolute necessity. He must admit that the command,
                &#8220;Thou shalt not lie,&#8221; does not hold only for men, as if
                other rational beings had no need to abide by it, and so
                with all the other moral laws properly so called. And he
                must concede that the ground of obligation here must
                therefore be sought not in the world in which man is
                placed, but must be sought...solely in the concepts of
                pure reason.... (Kant, 1).<br>
              </div>
              <br>
              Without using Kant's words, explain how Kant argues here
              that the justification of moral laws must come from pure
              reason.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              49. What does Kant mean by "rational being"? Why are
              rational beings not necessarily human? Why are some human
              beings not rational beings?<br>
              <br>
              50. Given Kant's commitment to justifying moral laws by
              pure reason, explain why Kant would reject some other
              views we have looked at in the course. Pick <span
                style="font-style: italic;">two </span>of the
              following: (a) cultural relativism; (b) Aquinas' natural
              law theory, (c) Glaucon's social contract; or (d) Bentham
              &amp; Mill's classical utilitarianism. Identify specific
              things about those two that would lead Kant to reject it.<br>
              <br>
              51. Lecture discussed why our motives are important in
              ethics. Give an example of some action, and explain how
              having different motives could make that act morally right
              or morally wrong. (You could use an example from class
              such as your boss giving you a gift, or make up some other
              example.)<br>
              <br>
              52. According to Kant, what are "inclinations"? (This was
              explained in class.) Why does Kant say that there may
              never have been a truly moral action (7)? To answer this,
              it will help to explain how inclinations are (a)
              unreliable (Kant, 1) and (b) sneaky (that is, unseen by
              us; 7). Finally, what does Kant think a truly moral action
              would be? <br>
              <br>
              53. What is a maxim? (Feldman discusses maxims on pp. 2-4,
              but the discussion in class may be more accessible, and
              class notes include a definition.)&nbsp; Give 2 examples
              NOT used in class or the text.<br>
              <br>
              54. State Kant&#8217;s categorical imperative, in the formula of
              universal law (FUL) (Kant, 10). Then identify the steps
              used to apply it (i.e, the "4-stage test"; see class
              notes).<br>
              <br>
              55. In class we discussed the maxim, "When I need money I
              shall rob a bank to get it." Explain how to test this
              maxim using the 4-stage test. Why does it fail?<br>
              <br>
              56. Kant gives an example of someone making a false
              promise (Kant, 11, #2, from "Another man in need...").
              What is the maxim in this case? Why does it fail the
              4-stage test?<br>
              <br>
              57. Lecture included Kant's example of refusing to give to
              the needy (Kant, 11, #4, from "A fourth man..."). What is
              the maxim in this case? Why does it fail? How is the
              failure here different from the failure in the
              bank-robbing case?<br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Situation (from Williams,
                3): </span>George&#8217;s lack of a job is causing trouble at
              home. He has the option of taking a research job at a
              chemical and biological weapons lab. Taking the job would
              be against his conscience; he opposes such weapons. But if
              George does not take the job, Zed will take it and
              enthusiastically pursue the research, creating more
              horrible ways to kill people.<br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
                  style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">58. </span>Using

















                the four-step test for applying Kant&#8217;s formula of
                universal law, determine whether George may take the
                job. To do this well you will have to explain each step
                carefully, especially steps 3 and (if you get to it) 4.<br>
              </div>
              &nbsp;<br>
              59. According to lecture, what should we expect from any
              good ethical theory? What are the different ways an
              ethical theory may fail? <br>
              <br>
              60. Feldman criticizes Kant&#8217;s formula of universal law for
              permitting some actions which really are wrong (Feldman,
              14-5). Give an example of this--one of Feldman&#8217;s, or one
              from class, or your own--and explain how it demonstrates
              this problem.<br>
              <br>
              61. Feldman argues that Kant&#8217;s formula of universal law is
              faulty because it forbids some actions which really should
              be allowed (Feldman, 15). Give an example of this, and
              explain how it demonstrates this problem. (The example may
              be one of Feldman&#8217;s, or one from class, or your own.)<br>
              <br>
              62. Using the example of choosing whether to keep a lunch
              date or give aid to an accident victim (Ross, 2), explain
              what Ross thinks is wrong with Kantianism.<br>
              <br>
              63. Using the example of choosing whether to keep a lunch
              date or aid an accident victim (Ross, 2), explain what
              Ross thinks is wrong with utilitarianism. Be sure to
              explain how Ross thinks that utilitarianism oversimplifies
              our relationships with others, and how Ross's view is
              different (2-3).<br>
              <br>
              64. Given the problems he identifies with Kantianism and
              consequentialism, what features does Ross think a proper
              ethical theory should have?<br>
              <br>
              65. According to Ross, what does it mean to say our duties
              are <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span>
              (Ross, 3, 5)? Identify six of our <span
                style="font-style: italic;">prima facie </span>duties,
              according to Ross (3-4).<br>
              <br>
              66. How does Ross say we should decide what to do (3)? <br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Situation: </span>See
              the situation described above for question 58 (George's
              job offer).<br>

              <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
                  style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">67. </span>Suppose















                you are George. Adopt Ross&#8217;s ethical theory. Explain
                whether you would take the job or not, and how you would
                arrive at that decision. To do so, first identify at
                least three relationships that are salient in this
                situation, and at least three <span style="font-style:
                  italic;">prima facie </span>duties arising from those
                relationships which apply in this situation. (By "at
                least three" I mean that is the minimum for a passable
                answer.) Given those duties to those people, and
                considering the situation, which duty (or duties) is
                overriding in this case? Why?<br>

                questions about Virtue Ethics</span></font><br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">68. In class we discussed
              reasons why we do bad things. Identify three of them.
              Explain why they are failures of character rather than
              failures of our ethical theories. How does this suggest
              that virtue theory has some value?<br>
              <br>
              69. Describe the "parts" (or "classes") Plato thinks the
              soul has (Plato, 129-31). According to Plato, what is the
              proper division of labor among the soul's parts (131)?<br>
              <br>
              70. Describe Plato's ideal soul. What are the virtues it
              would have, and what part(s) have them?<br>
              <br>
              <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">71. </span>According
              to Aristotle, why is happiness super important in ethics
              (Aristotle 1-2)? In your explanation, include why
              Aristotle thinks happiness is "complete,"
              "self-sufficient," and the "most choiceworthy" good. Why,
              then, is it important to know what happiness is
              (Aristotle, 1)?<br>
              <br>
              72. Given the properties happiness has according to
              Aristotle, explain why fame would not qualify has
              happiness. Why wouldn't wealth qualify?<br>
              <br>
              73. According to Aristotle, what is human happiness (3)?
              How does Aristotle figure that out? (I.e., explain the
              function argument, pp. 2-3.)<br>
              <br>
              74. How does Aristotle's conception of happiness differ
              from ours? In other words, why would Aristotle say we tend
              to use the word "happy" wrongly, and how does he say we
              should think of happiness? <br>
