              <br>
              [1] The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple
              principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings
              of society with the individual in the way of compulsion
              and control, whether the means used be physical force in
              the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of
              public opinion. That principle is, that the sole end for
              which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively
              in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their
              number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for
              which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of
              a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent
              harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is
              not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be
              compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for
              him to do so, because it will make him happier, because,
              in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even
              right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him,
              or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating
              him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any
              evil, in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the
              conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be
              calculated to produce evil to some one else. The only part
              of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to
              society, is that which concerns others. In the part which
              merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right,
              absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the
              individual is sovereign.<br>
              <br>
              [2] It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that this
              doctrine is meant to apply only to human beings in the
              maturity of their faculties. We are not speaking of
              children, or of young persons below the age which the law
              may fix as that of manhood or womanhood. Those who are
              still in a state to require being taken care of by others,
              must be protected against their own actions as well as
              against external injury. For the same reason, we may leave
              out of consideration those backward states of society in
              which the race itself may be considered as in its nonage.
              The early difficulties in the way of spontaneous progress
              are so great, that there is seldom any choice of means for
              overcoming them; and a ruler full of the spirit of
              improvement is warranted in the use of any expedients that
              will attain an end, perhaps otherwise unattainable.
              Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing
              with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement,
              and the means justified by actually effecting that end.
              Liberty, as a principle, has no application to any state
              of things anterior to the time when mankind have become
              capable of being improved by free and equal discussion.
              Until then, there is nothing for them but implicit
              obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne, if they are so
              fortunate as to find one. But as soon as mankind have
              attained the capacity of being guided to their own
              improvement by conviction or persuasion (a period long
              since reached in all nations with whom we need here
              concern ourselves), compulsion, either in the direct form
              or in that of pains and penalties for non-compliance, is
              no longer admissible as a means to their own good, and
              justifiable only for the security of others.<br>
              <br>
              [3] It is proper to state that I forego any advantage
              which could be derived to my argument from the idea of
              abstract right as a thing independent of utility. I regard
              utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions;
              but it must be utility in the largest sense, grounded on
              the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.
              Those interests, I contend, authorize the subjection of
              individual spontaneity to external control, only in
              respect to those actions of each, which concern the
              interest of other people. If any one does an act hurtful
              to others, there is a prima facie case for punishing him,
              by law, or, where legal penalties are not safely
              applicable, by general disapprobation. There are also many
              positive acts for the benefit of others, which he may
              rightfully be compelled to perform; such as, to give
              evidence in a court of justice; to bear his fair share in
              the common defence, or in any other joint work necessary
              to the interest of the society of which he enjoys the
              protection; and to perform certain acts of individual
              beneficence, such as saving a fellow-creature's life, or
              interposing to protect the defenceless against ill-usage,
              things which whenever it is obviously a man's duty to do,
              he may rightfully be made responsible to society for not
              doing. A person may cause evil to others not only by his
              actions but by his inaction, and in either case he is
              justly accountable to them for the injury. The latter
              case, it is true, requires a much more cautious exercise
              of compulsion than the former. To make any one answerable
              for doing evil to others, is the rule; to make him
              answerable for not preventing evil, is, comparatively
              speaking, the exception. Yet there are many cases clear
              enough and grave enough to justify that exception. In all
              things which regard the external relations of the
              individual, he is <span style="font-style: italic;">de
                jure</span> amenable to those whose interests are
              concerned, and if need be, to society as their protector.
              There are often good reasons for not holding him to the
              responsibility; but these reasons must arise from the
              special expediencies of the case: either because it is a
              kind of case in which he is on the whole likely to act
              better, when left to his own discretion, than when
              controlled in any way in which society have it in their
              power to control him; or because the attempt to exercise
              control would produce other evils, greater than those
              which it would prevent. When such reasons as these
              preclude the enforcement of responsibility, the conscience
              of the agent himself should step into the vacant
              judgment-seat, and protect those interests of others which
              have no external protection; judging himself all the more
              rigidly, because the case does not admit of his being made
              accountable to the judgment of his fellow-creatures.<br>
              <br>
              [4] But there is a sphere of action in which society, as
              distinguished from the individual, has, if any, only an
              indirect interest; comprehending all that portion of a
              person's life and conduct which affects only himself, or,
              if it also affects others, only with their free,
              voluntary, and undeceived consent and participation. When
              I say only himself, I mean directly, and in the first
              instance: for whatever affects himself, may affect others
              through himself; and the objection which may be grounded
              on this contingency, will receive consideration in the
              sequel. This, then, is the appropriate region of human
              liberty. It comprises, first, the inward domain of
              consciousness; demanding liberty of conscience, in the
              most comprehensive sense; liberty of thought and feeling;
              absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects,
              practical or speculative, scientific, moral, or
              theological. The liberty of expressing and publishing
              opinions may seem to fall under a different principle,
              since it belongs to that part of the conduct of an
              individual which concerns other people; but, being almost
              of as much importance as the liberty of thought itself,
              and resting in great part on the same reasons, is
              practically inseparable from it. Secondly, the principle
              requires liberty of tastes and pursuits; of framing the
              plan of our life to suit our own character; of doing as we
              like, subject to such consequences as may follow; without
              impediment from our fellow-creatures, so long as what we
              do does not harm them even though they should think our
              conduct foolish, perverse, or wrong. Thirdly, from this
              liberty of each individual, follows the liberty, within
              the same limits, of combination among individuals; freedom
              to unite, for any purpose not involving harm to others:
              the persons combining being supposed to be of full age,
              and not forced or deceived.<br>

                  II: Of the Liberty of Thought and Discussion</span></font><br>
            </div>
            <font style="font-family: Georgia;" size="-1"><br>
              [5] THE time, it is to be hoped, is gone by when any
              defence would be necessary of the "liberty of the press"
              as one of the securities against corrupt or tyrannical
              government. No argument, we may suppose, can now be
              needed, against permitting a legislature or an executive,
              not identified in interest with the people, to prescribe
              opinions to them, and determine what doctrines or what
              arguments they shall be allowed to hear. This aspect of
              the question, besides, has been so often and so
              triumphantly enforced by preceding writers, that it needs
              not be specially insisted on in this place. Though the law
              of England, on the subject of the press, is as servile to
              this day as it was in the time of the Tudors, there is
              little danger of its being actually put in force against
              political discussion, except during some temporary panic,
              when fear of insurrection drives ministers and judges from
              their propriety;[1] and, speaking generally, it is not, in
              constitutional countries, to be apprehended that the
              government, whether completely responsible to the people
              or not, will often attempt to control the expression of
              opinion, except when in doing so it makes itself the organ
              of the general intolerance of the public. Let us suppose,
              therefore, that the government is entirely at one with the
              people, and never thinks of exerting any power of coercion
              unless in agreement with what it conceives to be their
              voice. <br>
              <br>
              [6] But I deny the right of the people to exercise such
              coercion, either by themselves or by their government. The
              power itself is illegitimate. The best government has no
              more title to it than the worst. It is as noxious, or more
              noxious, when exerted in accordance with public opinion,
              than when in opposition to it. If all mankind minus one,
              were of one opinion, and only one person were of the
              contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in
              silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power,
              would be justified in silencing mankind. Were an opinion a
              personal possession of no value except to the owner; if to
              be obstructed in the enjoyment of it were simply a private
              injury, it would make some difference whether the injury
              was inflicted only on a few persons or on many. But the
              peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion
              is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well
              as the existing generation; those who dissent from the
              opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion
              is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of
              exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is
              almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and
              livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision
              with error.<br>
              <br>
              [7] It is necessary to consider separately these two
              hypotheses, each of which has a distinct branch of the
              argument corresponding to it. We can never be sure that
              the opinion we are endeavouring to stifle is a false
              opinion; and if we were sure, stifling it would be an evil
              still.<br>
              <br>
              [8] First: the opinion which it is attempted to suppress
              by authority may possibly be true. Those who desire to
              suppress it, of course deny its truth; but they are not
              infallible. They have no authority to decide the question
              for all mankind, and exclude every other person from the
              means of judging. To refuse a hearing to an opinion,
              because they are sure that it is false, is to assume that
              their certainty is the same thing as absolute certainty.
              All silencing of discussion is an assumption of
              infallibility. Its condemnation may be allowed to rest on
              this common argument, not the worse for being common.<br>
              <br>
              [9] Unfortunately for the good sense of mankind, the fact
              of their fallibility is far from carrying the weight in
              their practical judgment, which is always allowed to it in
              theory; for while every one well knows himself to be
              fallible, few think it necessary to take any precautions
              against their own fallibility, or admit the supposition
              that any opinion of which they feel very certain, may be
              one of the examples of the error to which they acknowledge
              themselves to be liable. Absolute princes, or others who
              are accustomed to unlimited deference, usually feel this
              complete confidence in their own opinions on nearly all
              subjects. People more happily situated, who sometimes hear
              their opinions disputed, and are not wholly unused to be
              set right when they are wrong, place the same unbounded
              reliance only on such of their opinions as are shared by
              all who surround them, or to whom they habitually defer:
              for in proportion to a man's want of confidence in his own
              solitary judgment, does he usually repose, with implicit
              trust, on the infallibility of "the world" in general. And
              the world, to each individual, means the part of it with
              which he comes in contact; his party, his sect, his
              church, his class of society: the man may be called, by
              comparison, almost liberal and large-minded to whom it
              means anything so comprehensive as his own country or his
              own age. Nor is his faith in this collective authority at
              all shaken by his being aware that other ages, countries,
              sects, churches, classes, and parties have thought, and
              even now think, the exact reverse. He devolves upon his
              own world the responsibility of being in the right against
              the dissentient worlds of other people; and it never
              troubles him that mere accident has decided which of these
              numerous worlds is the object of his reliance, and that
              the same causes which make him a Churchman in London,
              would have made him a Buddhist or a Confucian in Pekin.
              Yet it is as evident in itself as any amount of argument
              can make it, that ages are no more infallible than
              individuals; every age having held many opinions which
              subsequent ages have deemed not only false but absurd; and
              it is as certain that many opinions, now general, will be
              rejected by future ages, as it is that many, once general,
              are rejected by the present.<br>
              <br>
              [10] The objection likely to be made to this argument,
              would probably take some such form as the following. There
              is no greater assumption of infallibility in forbidding
              the propagation of error, than in any other thing which is
              done by public authority on its own judgment and
              responsibility. Judgment is given to men that they may use
              it. Because it may be used erroneously, are men to be told
              that they ought not to use it at all? To prohibit what
              they think pernicious, is not claiming exemption from
              error, but fulfilling the duty incumbent on them, although
              fallible, of acting on their conscientious conviction. If
              we were never to act on our opinions, because those
              opinions may be wrong, we should leave all our interests
              uncared for, and all our duties unperformed. An objection
              which applies to all conduct can be no valid objection to
              any conduct in particular.<br>
              <br>
              [11] It is the duty of governments, and of individuals, to
              form the truest opinions they can; to form them carefully,
              and never impose them upon others unless they are quite
              sure of being right. But when they are sure (such
              reasoners may say), it is not conscientiousness but
              cowardice to shrink from acting on their opinions, and
              allow doctrines which they honestly think dangerous to the
              welfare of mankind, either in this life or in another, to
              be scattered abroad without restraint, because other
              people, in less enlightened times, have persecuted
              opinions now believed to be true. Let us take care, it may
              be said, not to make the same mistake: but governments and
              nations have made mistakes in other things, which are not
              denied to be fit subjects for the exercise of authority:
              they have laid on bad taxes, made unjust wars. Ought we
              therefore to lay on no taxes, and, under whatever
              provocation, make no wars? Men, and governments, must act
              to the best of their ability. There is no such thing as
              absolute certainty, but there is assurance sufficient for
              the purposes of human life. We may, and must, assume our
              opinion to be true for the guidance of our own conduct:
              and it is assuming no more when we forbid bad men to
              pervert society by the propagation of opinions which we
              regard as false and pernicious.<br>
              <br>
              [12] I answer, that it is assuming very much more. There
              is the greatest difference between presuming an opinion to
              be true, because, with every opportunity for contesting
              it, it has not been refuted, and assuming its truth for
              the purpose of not permitting its refutation. Complete
              liberty of contradicting and disproving our opinion, is
              the very condition which justifies us in assuming its
              truth for purposes of action; and on no other terms can a
              being with human faculties have any rational assurance of
              being right.<br>
              <br>
              [13] When we consider either the history of opinion, or
              the ordinary conduct of human life, to what is it to be
              ascribed that the one and the other are no worse than they
              are? Not certainly to the inherent force of the human
              understanding; for, on any matter not self-evident, there
              are ninety-nine persons totally incapable of judging of
              it, for one who is capable; and the capacity of the
              hundredth person is only comparative; for the majority of
              the eminent men of every past generation held many
              opinions now known to be erroneous, and did or approved
              numerous things which no one will now justify. Why is it,
              then, that there is on the whole a preponderance among
              mankind of rational opinions and rational conduct? If
              there really is this preponderance--which there must be,
              unless human affairs are, and have always been, in an
              almost desperate state--it is owing to a quality of the
              human mind, the source of everything respectable in man,
              either as an intellectual or as a moral being, namely,
              that his errors are corrigible. He is capable of
              rectifying his mistakes by discussion and experience. Not
              by experience alone. There must be discussion, to show how
              experience is to be interpreted. Wrong opinions and
              practices gradually yield to fact and argument: but facts
              and arguments, to produce any effect on the mind, must be
              brought before it. Very few facts are able to tell their
              own story, without comments to bring out their meaning.
              The whole strength and value, then, of human judgment,
              depending on the one property, that it can be set right
              when it is wrong, reliance can be placed on it only when
              the means of setting it right are kept constantly at hand.
              In the case of any person whose judgment is really
              deserving of confidence, how has it become so? Because he
              has kept his mind open to criticism of his opinions and
              conduct. Because it has been his practice to listen to all
              that could be said against him; to profit by as much of it
              as was just, and expound to himself, and upon occasion to
              others, the fallacy of what was fallacious. Because he has
              felt, that the only way in which a human being can make
              some approach to knowing the whole of a subject, is by
              hearing what can be said about it by persons of every
              variety of opinion, and studying all modes in which it can
              be looked at by every character of mind. No wise man ever
              acquired his wisdom in any mode but this; nor is it in the
              nature of human intellect to become wise in any other
              manner. The steady habit of correcting and completing his
              own opinion by collating it with those of others, so far
              from causing doubt and hesitation in carrying it into
              practice, is the only stable foundation for a just
              reliance on it: for, being cognizant of all that can, at
              least obviously, be said against him, and having taken up
              his position against all gainsayers knowing that he has
              sought for objections and difficulties, instead of
              avoiding them, and has shut out no light which can be
              thrown upon the subject from any quarter--he has a right
              to think his judgment better than that of any person, or
              any multitude, who have not gone through a similar
              process.<br>
              <br>
              ...<br>
              <br>
              [14] Let us now pass to the second division of the
              argument, and dismissing the Supposition that any of the
              received opinions may be false, let us assume them to be
              true, and examine into the worth of the manner in which
              they are likely to be held, when their truth is not freely
              and openly canvassed. However unwillingly a person who has
              a strong opinion may admit the possibility that his
              opinion may be false, he ought to be moved by the
              consideration that however true it may be, if it is not
              fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed, it will be
              held as a dead dogma, not a living truth.<br>
              <br>
              [15] There is a class of persons (happily not quite so
              numerous as formerly) who think it enough if a person
              assents undoubtingly to what they think true, though he
              has no knowledge whatever of the grounds of the opinion,
              and could not make a tenable defence of it against the
              most superficial objections. Such persons, if they can
              once get their creed taught from authority, naturally
              think that no good, and some harm, comes of its being
              allowed to be questioned. Where their influence prevails,
              they make it nearly impossible for the received opinion to
              be rejected wisely and considerately, though it may still
              be rejected rashly and ignorantly; for to shut out
              discussion entirely is seldom possible, and when it once
              gets in, beliefs not grounded on conviction are apt to
              give way before the slightest semblance of an argument.
              Waiving, however, this possibility--assuming that the true
              opinion abides in the mind, but abides as a prejudice, a
              belief independent of, and proof against, argument--this
              is not the way in which truth ought to be held by a
              rational being. This is not knowing the truth. Truth, thus
              held, is but one superstition the more, accidentally
              clinging to the words which enunciate a truth.<br>
              <br>
              [16] If the intellect and judgment of mankind ought to be
              cultivated, a thing which Protestants at least do not
              deny, on what can these faculties be more appropriately
              exercised by any one, than on the things which concern him
              so much that it is considered necessary for him to hold
              opinions on them? If the cultivation of the understanding
              consists in one thing more than in another, it is surely
              in learning the grounds of one's own opinions. Whatever
              people believe, on subjects on which it is of the first
              importance to believe rightly, they ought to be able to
              defend against at least the common objections. But, some
              one may say, "Let them be <span style="font-style:
                italic;">taught </span>the grounds of their opinions.
              It does not follow that opinions must be merely parroted
              because they are never heard controverted. Persons who
              learn geometry do not simply commit the theorems to
              memory, but understand and learn likewise the
              demonstrations; and it would be absurd to say that they
              remain ignorant of the grounds of geometrical truths,
              because they never hear any one deny, and attempt to
              disprove them." Undoubtedly: and such teaching suffices on
              a subject like mathematics, where there is nothing at all
              to be said on the wrong side of the question. The
              peculiarity of the evidence of mathematical truths is,
              that all the argument is on one side. There are no
              objections, and no answers to objections. But on every
              subject on which difference of opinion is possible, the
              truth depends on a balance to be struck between two sets
              of conflicting reasons. Even in natural philosophy, there
              is always some other explanation possible of the same
              facts; some geocentric theory instead of heliocentric,
              some phlogiston instead of oxygen; and it has to be shown
              why that other theory cannot be the true one: and until
              this is shown and until we know how it is shown, we do not
              understand the grounds of our opinion. But when we turn to
              subjects infinitely more complicated, to morals, religion,
              politics, social relations, and the business of life,
              three-fourths of the arguments for every disputed opinion
              consist in dispelling the appearances which favor some
              opinion different from it. The greatest orator, save one,
              of antiquity, has left it on record that he always studied
              his adversary's case with as great, if not with still
              greater, intensity than even his own. What Cicero
              practised as the means of forensic success, requires to be
              imitated by all who study any subject in order to arrive
              at the truth. He who knows only his own side of the case,
              knows little of that. His reasons may be good, and no one
              may have been able to refute them. But if he is equally
              unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side; if he
              does not so much as know what they are, he has no ground
              for preferring either opinion. The rational position for
              him would be suspension of judgment, and unless he
              contents himself with that, he is either led by authority,
              or adopts, like the generality of the world, the side to
              which he feels most inclination. Nor is it enough that he
              should hear the arguments of adversaries from his own
              teachers, presented as they state them, and accompanied by
              what they offer as refutations. This is not the way to do
              justice to the arguments, or bring them into real contact
              with his own mind. He must be able to hear them from
              persons who actually believe them; who defend them in
              earnest, and do their very utmost for them. He must know
              them in their most plausible and persuasive form; he must
              feel the whole force of the difficulty which the true view
              of the subject has to encounter and dispose of, else he
              will never really possess himself of the portion of truth
              which meets and removes that difficulty. Ninety-nine in a
              hundred of what are called educated men are in this
              condition, even of those who can argue fluently for their
              opinions. Their conclusion may be true, but it might be
              false for anything they know: they have never thrown
              themselves into the mental position of those who think
              differently from them, and considered what such persons
              may have to say; and consequently they do not, in any
              proper sense of the word, know the doctrine which they
              themselves profess....<br>
              <br>
              [17] We have now recognized the necessity to the mental
              well-being of mankind (on which all their other well-being
              depends) of freedom of opinion, and freedom of the
              expression of opinion, on four distinct grounds; which we
              will now briefly recapitulate.<br>

                compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we can
                certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our
                own infallibility.</font><br>
              <br>
              <font style="font-family: Georgia;" size="-1">[19]
                Secondly, though the silenced opinion be an error, it
                may, and very commonly does, contain a portion of truth;
                and since the general or prevailing opinion on any
                object is rarely or never the whole truth, it is only by
                the collision of adverse opinions that the remainder of
                the truth has any chance of being supplied.</font><br>

                Thirdly, even if the received opinion be not only true,
                but the whole truth; unless it is suffered to be, and
                actually is, vigorously and earnestly contested, it
                will, by most of those who receive it, be held in the
                manner of a prejudice, with little comprehension or
                feeling of its rational grounds. And not only this, but,
                fourthly, the meaning of the doctrine itself will be in
                danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and deprived of its
                vital effect on the character and conduct: the dogma
                becoming a mere formal profession, inefficacious for
                good, but cumbering the ground, and preventing the
                growth of any real and heartfelt conviction, from reason
                or personal experience.</font><br>

              [21] SUCH being the reasons which make it imperative that
              human beings should be free to form opinions, and to
              express their opinions without reserve; and such the
              baneful consequences to the intellectual, and through that
              to the moral nature of man, unless this liberty is either
              conceded, or asserted in spite of prohibition; let us next
              examine whether the same reasons do not require that men
              should be free to act upon their opinions--to carry these
              out in their lives, without hindrance, either physical or
              moral, from their fellow-men, so long as it is at their
              own risk and peril. This last proviso is of course
              indispensable. No one pretends that actions should be as
              free as opinions. On the contrary, even opinions lose
              their immunity, when the circumstances in which they are
              expressed are such as to constitute their expression a
              positive instigation to some mischievous act. An opinion
              that corn-dealers are starvers of the poor, or that
              private property is robbery, ought to be unmolested when
              simply circulated through the press, but may justly incur
              punishment when delivered orally to an excited mob
              assembled before the house of a corn-dealer, or when
              handed about among the same mob in the form of a placard.
              Acts of whatever kind, which, without justifiable cause,
              do harm to others, may be, and in the more important cases
              absolutely require to be, controlled by the unfavorable
              sentiments, and, when needful, by the active interference
              of mankind. The liberty of the individual must be thus far
              limited; he must not make himself a nuisance to other
              people. But if he refrains from molesting others in what
              concerns them, and merely acts according to his own
              inclination and judgment in things which concern himself,
              the same reasons which show that opinion should be free,
              prove also that he should be allowed, without molestation,
              to carry his opinions into practice at his own cost. That
              mankind are not infallible; that their truths, for the
              most part, are only half-truths; that unity of opinion,
              unless resulting from the fullest and freest comparison of
              opposite opinions, is not desirable, and diversity not an
              evil, but a good, until mankind are much more capable than
              at present of recognizing all sides of the truth, are
              principles applicable to men's modes of action, not less
              than to their opinions. As it is useful that while mankind
              are imperfect there should be different opinions, so is it
              that there should be different experiments of living; that
              free scope should be given to varieties of character,
              short of injury to others; and that the worth of different
              modes of life should be proved practically, when any one
              thinks fit to try them. It is desirable, in short, that in
              things which do not primarily concern others,
              individuality should assert itself. Where, not the
              person's own character, but the traditions of customs of
              other people are the rule of conduct, there is wanting one
              of the principal ingredients of human happiness, and quite
              the chief ingredient of individual and social progress.<br>
              ...<br>
              <br>
              [22] Having said that Individuality is the same thing with
              development, and that it is only the cultivation of
              individuality which produces, or can produce,
              well-developed human beings, I might here close the
              argument: for what more or better can be said of any
              condition of human affairs, than that it brings human
              beings themselves nearer to the best thing they can be? or
              what worse can be said of any obstruction to good, than
              that it prevents this? Doubtless, however, these
              considerations will not suffice to convince those who most
              need convincing; and it is necessary further to show, that
              these developed human beings are of some use to the
              undeveloped--to point out to those who do not desire
              liberty, and would not avail themselves of it, that they
              may be in some intelligible manner rewarded for allowing
              other people to make use of it without hindrance.<br>
              <br>
              [23] In the first place, then, I would suggest that they
              might possibly learn something from them. It will not be
              denied by anybody, that originality is a valuable element
              in human affairs. There is always need of persons not only
              to discover new truths, and point out when what were once
              truths are true no longer, but also to commence new
              practices, and set the example of more enlightened
              conduct, and better taste and sense in human life. This
              cannot well be gainsaid by anybody who does not believe
              that the world has already attained perfection in all its
              ways and practices. It is true that this benefit is not
              capable of being rendered by everybody alike: there are
              but few persons, in comparison with the whole of mankind,
              whose experiments, if adopted by others, would be likely
              to be any improvement on established practice. But these
              few are the salt of the earth; without them, human life
              would become a stagnant pool. Not only is it they who
              introduce good things which did not before exist; it is
              they who keep the life in those which already existed. If
              there were nothing new to be done, would human intellect
              cease to be necessary? Would it be a reason why those who
              do the old things should forget why they are done, and do
              them like cattle, not like human beings? There is only too
              great a tendency in the best beliefs and practices to
              degenerate into the mechanical; and unless there were a
              succession of persons whose ever-recurring originality
              prevents the grounds of those beliefs and practices from
              becoming merely traditional, such dead matter would not
              resist the smallest shock from anything really alive, and
              there would be no reason why civilization should not die
              out, as in the Byzantine Empire....<br>
              <br>
              [24] I have said that it is important to give the freest
              scope possible to uncustomary things, in order that it may
              in time appear which of these are fit to be converted into
              customs. But independence of action, and disregard of
              custom are not solely deserving of encouragement for the
              chance they afford that better modes of action, and
              customs more worthy of general adoption, may be struck
              out; nor is it only persons of decided mental superiority
              who have a just claim to carry on their lives in their own
              way. There is no reason that all human existences should
              be constructed on some one, or some small number of
              patterns. If a person possesses any tolerable amount of
              common sense and experience, his own mode of laying out
              his existence is the best, not because it is the best in
              itself, but because it is his own mode. Human beings are
              not like sheep; and even sheep are not undistinguishably
              alike. A man cannot get a coat or a pair of boots to fit
              him, unless they are either made to his measure, or he has
              a whole warehouseful to choose from: and is it easier to
              fit him with a life than with a coat, or are human beings
              more like one another in their whole physical and
              spiritual conformation than in the shape of their feet? If
              it were only that people have diversities of taste that is
              reason enough for not attempting to shape them all after
              one model. But different persons also require different
              conditions for their spiritual development; and can no
              more exist healthily in the same moral, than all the
              variety of plants can in the same physical atmosphere and
              climate. The same things which are helps to one person
              towards the cultivation of his higher nature, are
              hindrances to another. The same mode of life is a healthy
              excitement to one, keeping all his faculties of action and
              enjoyment in their best order, while to another it is a
              distracting burden, which suspends or crushes all internal
              life. Such are the differences among human beings in their
              sources of pleasure, their susceptibilities of pain, and
              the operation on them of different physical and moral
              agencies, that unless there is a corresponding diversity
              in their modes of life, they neither obtain their fair
              share of happiness, nor grow up to the mental, moral, and
              aesthetic stature of which their nature is capable. ...<br>

              <br>
              [25] It would be a great misunderstanding of this
              doctrine, to suppose that it is one of selfish
              indifference, which pretends that human beings have no
              business with each other's conduct in life, and that they
              should not concern themselves about the well-doing or
              well-being of one another, unless their own interest is
              involved. Instead of any diminution, there is need of a
              great increase of disinterested exertion to promote the
              good of others. But disinterested benevolence can find
              other instruments to persuade people to their good, than
              whips and scourges, either of the literal or the
              metaphorical sort. I am the last person to undervalue the
              self-regarding virtues; they are only second in
              importance, if even second, to the social. It is equally
              the business of education to cultivate both. But even
              education works by conviction and persuasion as well as by
              compulsion, and it is by the former only that, when the
              period of education is past, the self-regarding virtues
              should be inculcated. Human beings owe to each other help
              to distinguish the better from the worse, and
              encouragement to choose the former and avoid the latter.
              They should be forever stimulating each other to increased
              exercise of their higher faculties, and increased
              direction of their feelings and aims towards wise instead
              of foolish, elevating instead of degrading, objects and
              contemplations. But neither one person, nor any number of
              persons, is warranted in saying to another human creature
              of ripe years, that he shall not do with his life for his
              own benefit what he chooses to do with it. He is the
              person most interested in his own well-being, the interest
              which any other person, except in cases of strong personal
              attachment, can have in it, is trifling, compared with
              that which he himself has; the interest which society has
              in him individually (except as to his conduct to others)
              is fractional, and altogether indirect: while, with
              respect to his own feelings and circumstances, the most
              ordinary man or woman has means of knowledge immeasurably
              surpassing those that can be possessed by any one else.
              The interference of society to overrule his judgment and
              purposes in what only regards himself, must be grounded on
              general presumptions; which may be altogether wrong, and
              even if right, are as likely as not to be misapplied to
              individual cases, by persons no better acquainted with the
              circumstances of such cases than those are who look at
              them merely from without. In this department, therefore,
              of human affairs, Individuality has its proper field of
              action. In the conduct of human beings towards one
              another, it is necessary that general rules should for the
              most part be observed, in order that people may know what
              they have to expect; but in each person's own concerns,
              his individual spontaneity is entitled to free exercise.
              Considerations to aid his judgment, exhortations to
              strengthen his will, may be offered to him, even obtruded
              on him, by others; but he, himself, is the final judge.
              All errors which he is likely to commit against advice and
              warning, are far outweighed by the evil of allowing others
              to constrain him to what they deem his good.<br>
              <br>
              ...<br>
              <br>
              [26] The distinction here pointed out between the part of
              a person's life which concerns only himself, and that
              which concerns others, many persons will refuse to admit.
              How (it may be asked) can any part of the conduct of a
              member of society be a matter of indifference to the other
              members? No person is an entirely isolated being; it is
              impossible for a person to do anything seriously or
              permanently hurtful to himself, without mischief reaching
              at least to his near connections, and often far beyond
              them. If he injures his property, he does harm to those
              who directly or indirectly derived support from it, and
              usually diminishes, by a greater or less amount, the
              general resources of the community. If he deteriorates his
              bodily or mental faculties, he not only brings evil upon
              all who depended on him for any portion of their
              happiness, but disqualifies himself for rendering the
              services which he owes to his fellow-creatures generally;
              perhaps becomes a burden on their affection or
              benevolence; and if such conduct were very frequent,
              hardly any offence that is committed would detract more
              from the general sum of good. Finally, if by his vices or
              follies a person does no direct harm to others, he is
              nevertheless (it may be said) injurious by his example;
              and ought to be compelled to control himself, for the sake
              of those whom the sight or knowledge of his conduct might
              corrupt or mislead.<br>
              <br>
              [27] And even (it will be added) if the consequences of
              misconduct could be confined to the vicious or thoughtless
              individual, ought society to abandon to their own guidance
              those who are manifestly unfit for it? If protection
              against themselves is confessedly due to children and
              persons under age, is not society equally bound to afford
              it to persons of mature years who are equally incapable of
              self-government? If gambling, or drunkenness, or
              incontinence, or idleness, or uncleanliness, are as
              injurious to happiness, and as great a hindrance to
              improvement, as many or most of the acts prohibited by
              law, why (it may be asked) should not law, so far as is
              consistent with practicability and social convenience,
              endeavor to repress these also? And as a supplement to the
              unavoidable imperfections of law, ought not opinion at
              least to organize a powerful police against these vices,
              and visit rigidly with social penalties those who are
              known to practise them? There is no question here (it may
              be said) about restricting individuality, or impeding the
              trial of new and original experiments in living. The only
              things it is sought to prevent are things which have been
              tried and condemned from the beginning of the world until
              now; things which experience has shown not to be useful or
              suitable to any person's individuality. There must be some
              length of time and amount of experience, after which a
              moral or prudential truth may be regarded as established,
              and it is merely desired to prevent generation after
              generation from falling over the same precipice which has
              been fatal to their predecessors.<br>
              <br>
              [28] I fully admit that the mischief which a person does
              to himself, may seriously affect, both through their
              sympathies and their interests, those nearly connected
              with him, and in a minor degree, society at large. When,
              by conduct of this sort, a person is led to violate a
              distinct and assignable obligation to any other person or
              persons, the case is taken out of the self-regarding
              class, and becomes amenable to moral disapprobation in the
              proper sense of the term. If, for example, a man, through
              intemperance or extravagance, becomes unable to pay his
              debts, or, having undertaken the moral responsibility of a
              family, becomes from the same cause incapable of
              supporting or educating them, he is deservedly reprobated,
              and might be justly punished; but it is for the breach of
              duty to his family or creditors, not for the extravagance.
              If the resources which ought to have been devoted to them,
              had been diverted from them for the most prudent
              investment, the moral culpability would have been the
              same. George Barnwell murdered his uncle to get money for
              his mistress, but if he had done it to set himself up in
              business, he would equally have been hanged. Again, in the
              frequent case of a man who causes grief to his family by
              addiction to bad habits, he deserves reproach for his
              unkindness or ingratitude; but so he may for cultivating
              habits not in themselves vicious, if they are painful to
              those with whom he passes his life, or who from personal
              ties are dependent on him for their comfort. Whoever fails
              in the consideration generally due to the interests and
              feelings of others, not being compelled by some more
              imperative duty, or justified by allowable
              self-preference, is a subject of moral disapprobation for
              that failure, but not for the cause of it, nor for the
              errors, merely personal to himself, which may have
              remotely led to it. In like manner, when a person disables
              himself, by conduct purely self-regarding, from the
              performance of some definite duty incumbent on him to the
              public, he is guilty of a social offence. No person ought
              to be punished simply for being drunk; but a soldier or a
              policeman should be punished for being drunk on duty.
              Whenever, in short, there is a definite damage, or a
              definite risk of damage, either to an individual or to the
              public, the case is taken out of the province of liberty,
              and placed in that of morality or law.<br>
              <br>
              ...<br>
              <br>
              [29] But the strongest of all the arguments against the
              interference of the public with purely personal conduct,
              is that when it does interfere, the odds are that it
              interferes wrongly, and in the wrong place. On questions
              of social morality, of duty to others, the opinion of the
              public, that is, of an overruling majority, though often
              wrong, is likely to be still oftener right; because on
              such questions they are only required to judge of their
              own interests; of the manner in which some mode of
              conduct, if allowed to be practised, would affect
              themselves. But the opinion of a similar majority, imposed
              as a law on the minority, on questions of self-regarding
              conduct, is quite as likely to be wrong as right; for in
              these cases public opinion means, at the best, some
              people's opinion of what is good or bad for other people;
              while very often it does not even mean that; the public,
              with the most perfect indifference, passing over the
              pleasure or convenience of those whose conduct they
              censure, and considering only their own preference. There
              are many who consider as an injury to themselves any
              conduct which they have a distaste for, and resent it as
              an outrage to their feelings; as a religious bigot, when
              charged with disregarding the religious feelings of
              others, has been known to retort that they disregard his
              feelings, by persisting in their abominable worship or
              creed. But there is no parity between the feeling of a
              person for his own opinion, and the feeling of another who
              is offended at his holding it; no more than between the
              desire of a thief to take a purse, and the desire of the
              right owner to keep it. And a person's taste is as much
              his own peculiar concern as his opinion or his purse. It
              is easy for any one to imagine an ideal public, which
              leaves the freedom and choice of individuals in all
              uncertain matters undisturbed, and only requires them to
              abstain from modes of conduct which universal experience
              has condemned. But where has there been seen a public
              which set any such limit to its censorship? or when does
              the public trouble itself about universal experience. In
              its interferences with personal conduct it is seldom
              thinking of anything but the enormity of acting or feeling
              differently from itself; and this standard of judgment,
              thinly disguised, is held up to mankind as the dictate of
              religion and philosophy, by nine tenths of all moralists
              and speculative writers. These teach that things are right
              because they are right; because we feel them to be so.
              They tell us to search in our own minds and hearts for
              laws of conduct binding on ourselves and on all others.
              What can the poor public do but apply these instructions,
              and make their own personal feelings of good and evil, if
              they are tolerably unanimous in them, obligatory on all
              the world?<br>
