            The paradoxes of intelligence reform. <br>

            <br>
            <big><big><big>I</big></big></big>n the fall of 1973, the
            Syrian Army began to gather a large number of tanks,
            artillery batteries, and infantry along its border with
            Israel. Simultaneously, to the south, the Egyptian Army
            cancelled all leaves, called up thousands of reservists, and
            launched a massive military exercise, building roads and
            preparing anti-aircraft and artillery positions along the
            Suez Canal. On October 4th, an Israeli aerial reconnaissance
            mission showed that the Egyptians had moved artillery into
            offensive positions. That evening, AMAN, the Israeli
            military intelligence agency, learned that portions of the
            Soviet fleet near Port Said and Alexandria had set sail, and
            that the Soviet government had begun airlifting the families
            of Soviet advisers out of Cairo and Damascus. Then, at four
            o&#8217;clock in the morning on October 6th, Israel&#8217;s director of
            military intelligence received an urgent telephone call from
            one of the country&#8217;s most trusted intelligence sources.
            Egypt and Syria, the source said, would attack later that
            day. Top Israeli officials immediately called a meeting. Was
            war imminent? The head of AMAN, Major General Eli Zeira,
            looked over the evidence and said he didn&#8217;t think so. He was
            wrong. That afternoon, Syria attacked from the east,
            overwhelming the thin Israeli defenses in the Golan Heights,
            and Egypt attacked from the south, bombing Israeli positions
            and sending eight thousand infantry streaming across the
            Suez. Despite all the warnings of the previous weeks,
            Israeli officials were caught by surprise. Why couldn&#8217;t they
            connect the dots?<br>
            <br>
            If you start on the afternoon of October 6th and work
            backward, the trail of clues pointing to an attack seems
            obvious; you&#8217;d have to conclude that something was badly
            wrong with the Israeli intelligence service. On the other
            hand, if you start several years before the Yom Kippur War
            and work forward, re-creating what people in Israeli
            intelligence knew in the same order that they knew it, a
            very different picture emerges. In the fall of 1973, Egypt
            and Syria certainly looked as if they were preparing to go
            to war. But, in the Middle East of the time, countries
            always looked as if they were going to war. In the fall of
            1971, for instance, both Egypt&#8217;s President and its minister
            of war stated publicly that the hour of battle was
            approaching. The Egyptian Army was mobilized. Tanks and
            bridging equipment were sent to the canal. Offensive
            positions were readied. And nothing happened. In December of
            1972, the Egyptians mobilized again. The Army furiously
            built fortifications along the canal. A reliable source told
            Israeli intelligence that an attack was imminent. Nothing
            happened. In the spring of 1973, the President of Egypt told
            Newsweek that everything in his country &#8220;is now being
            mobilized in earnest for the resumption of battle.&#8221; Egyptian
            forces were moved closer to the canal. Extensive
            fortifications were built along the Suez. Blood donors were
            rounded up. Civil-defense personnel were mobilized.
            Blackouts were imposed throughout Egypt. A trusted source
            told Israeli intelligence that an attack was imminent. It
            didn&#8217;t come. Between January and October of 1973, the
            Egyptian Army mobilized nineteen times without going to war.
            The Israeli government couldn&#8217;t mobilize its Army every time
            its neighbors threatened war. Israel is a small country with
            a citizen Army. Mobilization was disruptive and expensive,
            and the Israeli government was acutely aware that if its
            Army was mobilized and Egypt and Syria weren&#8217;t serious about
            war, the very act of mobilization might cause them to become
            serious about war. <br>
            <br>
            Nor did the other signs seem remarkable. The fact that the
            Soviet families had been sent home could have signified
            nothing more than a falling-out between the Arab states and
            Moscow. Yes, a trusted source called at four in the morning,
            with definite word of a lateafternoon attack, but his last
            two attack warnings had been wrong. What&#8217;s more, the source
            said that the attack would come at sunset, and an attack so
            late in the day wouldn&#8217;t leave enough time for opening air
            strikes. Israeli intelligence didn&#8217;t see the pattern of Arab
            intentions, in other words, because, until Egypt and Syria
            actually attacked, on the afternoon of October 6, 1973,
            their intentions didn&#8217;t form a pattern. They formed a
            Rorschach blot. What is clear in hindsight is rarely clear
            before the fact. It&#8217;s an obvious point, but one that
            nonetheless bears repeating, particularly when we&#8217;re in the
            midst of assigning blame for the surprise attack of
            September 11th.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <big><big><big>O</big></big></big>f the many postmortems
            conducted after September 11th, the one that has received
            the most attention is &#8220;The Cell: Inside the 9/11 Plot, and
            Why the F.B.I. and C.I.A. Failed to Stop It&#8221; (Hyperion;
            $24.95), by John Miller, Michael Stone, and Chris Mitchell.
            The authors begin their tale with El Sayyid Nosair, the
            Egyptian who was arrested in November of 1990 for shooting
            Rabbi Meir Kahane, the founder of the Jewish Defense League,
            in the ballroom of the Marriott Hotel in midtown Manhattan.
            Nosair&#8217;s apartment in New Jersey was searched, and
            investigators found sixteen boxes of files, including
            training manuals from the Army Special Warfare School;
            copies of teletypes that had been routed to the Joint Chiefs
            of Staff; bombmaking manuals; and maps, annotated in Arabic,
            of landmarks like the Statue of Liberty, Rockefeller Center,
            and the World Trade Center. According to &#8220;The Cell,&#8221; Nosair
            was connected to gunrunners and to Islamic radicals in
            Brooklyn, who were in turn behind the World Trade Center
            bombing two and a half years later, which was masterminded
            by Ramzi Yousef, who then showed up in Manila in 1994,
            apparently plotting to kill the Pope, crash a plane into the
            Pentagon or the C.I.A., and bomb as many as twelve
            transcontinental airliners simultaneously. And who was
            Yousef associating with in the Philippines? Mohammed
            Khalifa, Wali Khan AminShah, and Ibrahim Munir, all of whom
            had fought alongside, pledged a loyalty oath to, or worked
            for a shadowy Saudi Arabian millionaire named Osama bin
            Laden. <br>
            <br>
            Miller was a network-television correspondent throughout
            much of the past decade, and the best parts of &#8220;The Cell&#8221;
            recount his own experiences in covering the terrorist story.
            He is an extraordinary reporter. At the time of the first
            World Trade Center attack, in February of 1993, he clapped a
            flashing light on the dashboard of his car and followed the
            wave of emergency vehicles downtown. (At the bombing site,
            he was continuously trailed by a knot of reporters&#8212;I was one
            of them&#8212;who had concluded that the best way to learn what
            was going on was to try to overhear his conversations.)
            Miller became friends with the F.B.I. agents who headed the
            New York counterterrorist office&#8212;Neil Herman and John
            O&#8217;Neill, in particular&#8212;and he became as obsessed with Al
            Qaeda as they were. He was in Yemen, with the F.B.I., after
            Al Qaeda bombed the U.S.S. Cole. In 1998, at the Marriott in
            Islamabad, he and his cameraman met someone known to them
            only as Akhtar, who spirited them across the border into the
            hills of Afghanistan to interview Osama bin Laden. In &#8220;The
            Cell,&#8221; the period from 1990 through September 11th becomes a
            seamless, devastating narrative: the evolution of Al Qaeda.
            &#8220;How did this happen to us?&#8221; the book asks in its opening
            pages. The answer, the authors argue, can be found by
            following the &#8220;thread&#8221; connecting Kahane&#8217;s murder to
            September 11th. In the events of the past decade, they
            declare, there is a clear &#8220;recurring pattern.&#8221;<br>
            <br>
            The same argument is made by Senator Richard Shelby,
            vice-chairman of the Senate Select Committee on
            Intelligence, in his investigative report on September 11th,
            released this past December. The report is a lucid and
            powerful document, in which Shelby painstakingly points out
            all the missed or misinterpreted signals pointing to a major
            terrorist attack. The C.I.A. knew that two suspected Al
            Qaeda operatives, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, had
            entered the country, but the C.I.A. didn&#8217;t tell the F.B.I.
            or the N.S.C. An F.B.I. agent in Phoenix sent a memo to
            headquarters that began with the sentence &#8220;The purpose of
            this communication is to advise the bureau and New York of
            the possibility of a coordinated effort by Osama Bin Laden
            to send students to the United States to attend civilian
            aviation universities and colleges.&#8221; But the F.B.I. never
            acted on the information, and failed to connect it with
            reports that terrorists were interested in using airplanes
            as weapons. The F.B.I. took into custody the suspected
            terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui, on account of his suspicious
            behavior at flight school, but was unable to integrate his
            case into a larger picture of terrorist behavior. &#8220;The most
            fundamental problem . . . is our Intelligence Community&#8217;s
            inability to &#8216;connect the dots&#8217; available to it before
            September 11, 2001, about terrorists&#8217; interest in attacking
            symbolic American targets,&#8221; the Shelby report states. The
            phrase &#8220;connect the dots&#8221; appears so often in the report
            that it becomes a kind of mantra. There was a pattern, as
            plain as day in retrospect, yet the vaunted American
            intelligence community simply could not see it.<br>
            <br>
            None of these postmortems, however, answer the question
            raised by the Yom Kippur War: Was this pattern obvious
            before the attack? This question&#8212;whether we revise our
            judgment of events after the fact&#8212;is something that
            psychologists have paid a great deal of attention to. For
            example, on the eve of Richard Nixon&#8217;s historic visit to
            China, the psychologist Baruch Fischhoff asked a group of
            people to estimate the probability of a series of possible
            outcomes of the trip. What were the chances that the trip
            would lead to permanent diplomatic relations between China
            and the United States? That Nixon would meet with the leader
            of China, Mao Tse-tung, at least once? That Nixon would call
            the trip a success? As it turned out, the trip was a
            diplomatic triumph, and Fischhoff then went back to the same
            people and asked them to recall what their estimates of the
            different outcomes of the visit had been. He found that the
            subjects now, overwhelmingly, &#8220;remembered&#8221; being more
            optimistic than they had actually been. If you originally
            thought that it was unlikely that Nixon would meet with Mao,
            afterward, when the press was full of accounts of Nixon&#8217;s
            meeting with Mao, you&#8217;d &#8220;remember&#8221; that you had thought the
            chances of a meeting were pretty good. Fischhoff calls this
            phenomenon &#8220;creeping determinism&#8221;&#8212;the sense that grows on
            us, in retrospect, that what has happened was actually
            inevitable&#8212;and the chief effect of creeping determinism, he
            points out, is that it turns unexpected events into expected
            events. As he writes, &#8220;The occurrence of an event increases
            its reconstructed probability and makes it less surprising
            than it would have been had the original probability been
            remembered.&#8221;<br>
            <br>
            To read the Shelby report, or the seamless narrative from
            Nosair to bin Laden in &#8220;The Cell,&#8221; is to be convinced that
            if the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. had simply been able to connect
            the dots what happened on September 11th should not have
            been a surprise at all. Is this a fair criticism or is it
            just a case of creeping determinism?<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <big><big><big>O</big></big></big>n August 7, 1998, two Al
            Qaeda terrorists detonated a cargo truck filled with
            explosives outside the United States Embassy in Nairobi,
            killing two hundred and thirteen people and injuring more
            than four thousand. Miller, Stone, and Mitchell see the
            Kenyan Embassy bombing as a textbook example of intelligence
            failure. The C.I.A., they tell us, had identified an Al
            Qaeda cell in Kenya well before the attack, and its members
            were under surveillance. They had an eight-page letter,
            written by an Al Qaeda operative, speaking of the imminent
            arrival of &#8220;engineers&#8221;&#8212;the code word for bombmakers&#8212;in
            Nairobi. The United States Ambassador to Kenya, Prudence
            Bushnell, had begged Washington for more security. A
            prominent Kenyan lawyer and legislator says that the Kenyan
            intelligence service warned U.S. intelligence about the plot
            several months before August 7th, and in November of 1997 a
            man named Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, who worked for one of
            Osama bin Laden&#8217;s companies, walked into the United States
            Embassy in Nairobi and told American intelligence of a plot
            to blow up the building. What did our officials do? They
            forced the leader of the Kenyan cell&#8212;a U.S. citizen&#8212;to
            return home, and then abruptly halted their surveillance of
            the group. They ignored the eight-page letter. They
            allegedly showed the Kenyan intelligence service&#8217;s warning
            to the Mossad, which dismissed it, and after questioning
            Ahmed they decided that he wasn&#8217;t credible. After the
            bombing, &#8220;The Cell&#8221; tells us, a senior State Department
            official phoned Bushnell and asked, &#8220;How could this have
            happened?&#8221;<br>
            <br>
            &#8220;For the first time since the blast,&#8221; Miller, Stone, and
            Mitchell write, &#8220;Bushnell&#8217;s horror turned to anger. There
            was too much history. &#8216;I wrote you a letter,&#8217; she said.&#8221;<br>
            <br>
            This is all very damning, but doesn&#8217;t it fall into the
            creeping-determinism trap? It is not at all clear that it
            passes the creeping-determinism test. It&#8217;s an edited version
            of the past. What we don&#8217;t hear about is all the other
            people whom American intelligence had under surveillance,
            how many other warnings they received, and how many other
            tips came in that seemed promising at the time but led
            nowhere. The central challenge of intelligence gathering has
            always been the problem of &#8220;noise&#8221;: the fact that useless
            information is vastly more plentiful than useful
            information. Shelby&#8217;s report mentions that the F.B.I.&#8217;s
            counterterrorism division has sixty-eight thousand
            outstanding and unassigned leads dating back to 1995. And,
            of those, probably no more than a few hundred are useful.
            Analysts, in short, must be selective, and the decisions
            made in Kenya, by that standard, do not seem unreasonable.
            Surveillance on the cell was shut down, but, then, its
            leader had left the country. Bushnell warned Washington&#8212;but,
            as &#8220;The Cell&#8221; admits, there were bomb warnings in Africa all
            the time. Officials at the Mossad thought the Kenyan
            intelligence was dubious, and the Mossad ought to know.
            Ahmed may have worked for bin Laden but he failed a
            polygraph test, and it was also learned that he had
            previously given similar&#8212;groundless&#8212;warnings to other
            embassies in Africa. When a man comes into your office,
            fails a lie-detector test, and is found to have shopped the
            same unsubstantiated story all over town, can you be blamed
            for turning him out?<br>
            <br>
            Miller, Stone, and Mitchell make the same mistake when they
            quote from a transcript of a conversation that was recorded
            by Italian intelligence in August of 2001 between two Al
            Qaeda operatives, Abdel Kader Es Sayed and a man known as al
            Hilal. This, they say, is yet another piece of intelligence
            that &#8220;seemed to forecast the September 11 attacks.&#8221;<br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been studying
              airplanes,&#8221; al Hilal tells Es Sayed. &#8220;If God wills, I hope
              to be able to bring you a window or a piece of a plane the
              next time I see you.&#8221; <br>
              &#8220;What, is there a jihad planned?&#8221; Es Sayed asks. <br>
              &#8220;In the future, listen to the news and remember these
              words: &#8216;Up above,&#8217;&#8221; al Hilal replies. <br>
              Es Sayed thinks that al Hilal is referring to an operation
              in his native Yemen, but al Hilal corrects him: &#8220;But the
              surprise attack will come from the other country, one of
              those attacks you will never forget.&#8221; <br>
              A moment later al Hilal says about the plan, &#8220;It is
              something terrifying that goes from south to north, east
              to west. The person who devised this plan is a madman, but
              a genius. He will leave them frozen [in shock].&#8221; <br>

            This is a tantalizing exchange. It would now seem that it
            refers to September 11th. But in what sense was it a
            &#8220;forecast&#8221;? It gave neither time nor place nor method nor
            target. It suggested only that there were terrorists out
            there who liked to talk about doing something dramatic with
            an airplane&#8212;which did not, it must be remembered, reliably
            distinguish them from any other terrorists of the past
            thirty years.<br>
            <br>
            In the real world, intelligence is invariably ambiguous.
            Information about enemy intentions tends to be short on
            detail. And information that&#8217;s rich in detail tends to be
            short on intentions. In April of 1941, for instance, the
            Allies learned that Germany had moved a huge army up to the
            Russian front. The intelligence was beyond dispute: the
            troops could be seen and counted. But what did it mean?
            Churchill concluded that Hitler wanted to attack Russia.
            Stalin concluded that Hitler was serious about attacking,
            but only if the Soviet Union didn&#8217;t meet the terms of the
            German ultimatum. The British foreign secretary, Anthony
            Eden, thought that Hitler was bluffing, in the hope of
            winning further Russian concessions. British intelligence
            thought&#8212;at least, in the beginning&#8212;that Hitler simply wanted
            to reinforce his eastern frontier against a possible Soviet
            attack. The only way for this piece of intelligence to have
            been definitive wold have been if the Allies had a second
            piece of intelligence&#8212;like the phone call between al Hilal
            and Es Sayed&#8212;that demonstrated Germany&#8217;s true purpose.
            Similarly, the only way the al Hilal phone call would have
            been definitive is if we&#8217;d also had intelligence as detailed
            as the Allied knowledge of German troop movements. But
            rarely do intelligence services have the luxury of both
            kinds of information. Nor are their analysts mind readers.
            It is only with hindsight that human beings acquire that
            skill.<br>
            <br>
            &#8220;The Cell&#8221; tells us that, in the final months before
            September 11th, Washington was frantic with worry:<br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">A spike in phone traffic
              among suspected al Qaeda members in the early part of the
              summer [of 2001], as well as debriefings of [an al Qaeda
              operative in custody] who had begun cooperating with the
              government, convinced investigators that bin Laden was
              planning a significant operation&#8212;one intercepted al Qaeda
              message spoke of a &#8220;Hiroshima-type&#8221; event&#8212;and that he was
              planning it soon. Through the summer, the CIA repeatedly
              warned the White House that attacks were imminent. <br>
            </div>
            <br>
            The fact that these worries did not protect us is not
            evidence of the limitations of the intelligence community.
            It is evidence of the limitations of intelligence.<br>

            <br>
            <big><big><big>I</big></big></big>n the early
            nineteen-seventies, a professor of psychology at Stanford
            University named David L. Rosenhan gathered together a
            painter, a graduate student, a pediatrician, a psychiatrist,
            a housewife, and three psychologists. He told them to check
            into different psychiatric hospitals under aliases, with the
            complaint that they had been hearing voices. They were
            instructed to say that the voices were unfamiliar, and that
            they heard words like &#8220;empty,&#8221;&#8220;thud,&#8221; and &#8220;hollow.&#8221; Apart
            from that initial story, the pseudo patients were instructed
            to answer every question truthfully, to behave as they
            normally would, and to tell the hospital staff&#8212;at every
            opportunity&#8212;that the voices were gone and that they had
            experienced no further symptoms. The eight subjects were
            hospitalized, on average, for nineteen days. One was kept
            for almost two months. Rosenhan wanted to find out if the
            hospital staffs would ever see through the ruse. They never
            did.<br>
            <br>
            Rosenhan&#8217;s test is, in a way, a classic intelligence
            problem. Here was a signal (a sane person) buried in a
            mountain of conflicting and confusing noise (a mental
            hospital), and the intelligence analysts (the doctors) were
            asked to connect the dots&#8212;and they failed spectacularly. In
            the course of their hospital stay, the eight pseudo patients
            were given a total of twenty-one hundred pills. They
            underwent psychiatric interviews, and sober case summaries
            documenting their pathologies were written up. They were
            asked by Rosenhan to take notes documenting how they were
            treated, and this quickly became part of their supposed
            pathology. &#8220;Patient engaging in writing behavior,&#8221; one nurse
            ominously wrote in her notes. Having been labelled as ill
            upon admission, they could not shake the diagnosis.
            &#8220;Nervous?&#8221; a friendly nurse asked one of the subjects as he
            paced the halls one day. &#8220;No,&#8221; he corrected her, to no
            avail, &#8220;bored.&#8221;<br>
            <br>
            The solution to this problem seems obvious enough. Doctors
            and nurses need to be made alert to the possibility that
            sane people sometimes get admitted to mental hospitals. So
            Rosenhan went to a research-and-teaching hospital and
            informed the staff that at some point in the next three
            months he would once again send over one or more of his
            pseudo patients. This time, of the hundred and ninety-three
            patients admitted in the three-month period, forty-one were
            identified by at least one staff member as being almost
            certainly sane. Once again, however, they were wrong.
            Rosenhan hadn&#8217;t sent anyone over. In attempting to solve one
            kind of intelligence problem (overdiagnosis), the hospital
            simply created another problem (underdiagnosis). This is the
            second, and perhaps more serious, consequence of creeping
            determinism: in our zeal to correct what we believe to be
            the problems of the past, we end up creating new problems
            for the future.<br>
            <br>
            Pearl Harbor, for example, was widely considered to be an
            organizational failure. The United States had all the
            evidence it needed to predict the Japanese attack, but the
            signals were scattered throughout the various intelligence
            services. The Army and the Navy didn&#8217;t talk to each other.
            They spent all their time arguing and competing. This was,
            in part, why the Central Intelligence Agency was created, in
            1947&#8212;to insure that all intelligence would be collected and
            processed in one place. Twenty years after Pearl Harbor, the
            United States suffered another catastrophic intelligence
            failure, at the Bay of Pigs: the Kennedy Administration
            grossly underestimated the Cubans&#8217; capacity to fight and
            their support for Fidel Castro. This time, however, the
            diagnosis was completely different. As Irving L. Janis
            concluded in his famous study of &#8220;groupthink,&#8221; the root
            cause of the Bay of Pigs fiasco was that the operation was
            conceived by a small, highly cohesive group whose close ties
            inhibited the beneficial effects of argument and
            competition. Centralization was now the problem. One of the
            most influential organizational sociologists of the postwar
            era, Harold Wilensky, went out of his way to praise the
            &#8220;constructive rivalry&#8221; fostered by Franklin D. Roosevelt,
            which, he says, is why the President had such formidable
            intelligence on how to attack the economic ills of the Great
            Depression. In his classic 1967 work &#8220;Organizational
            Intelligence,&#8221; Wilensky pointed out that Roosevelt would<br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">use one anonymous
              informant&#8217;s information to challenge and check another&#8217;s,
              putting both on their toes; he recruited strong
              personalities and structured their work so that clashes
              would be certain. . . . In foreign affairs, he gave Moley
              and Welles tasks that overlapped those of Secretary of
              State Hull; in conservation and power, he gave Ickes and
              Wallace identical missions; in welfare, confusing both
              functions and initials, he assigned PWA to Ickes, WPA to
              Hopkins; in politics, Farley found himself competing with
              other political advisors for control over patronage. The
              effect: the timely advertisement of arguments, with both
              the experts and the President pressured to consider the
              main choices as they came boiling up from below. <br>
            </div>
            <br>
            The intelligence community that we had prior to September
            11th was the direct result of this philosophy. The F.B.I.
            and the C.I.A. were supposed to be rivals, just as Ickes and
            Wallace were rivals. But now we&#8217;ve changed our minds. The
            F.B.I. and the C.I.A., Senator Shelby tells us
            disapprovingly, argue and compete with one another. The
            September 11th story, his report concludes, &#8220;should be an
            object lesson in the perils of failing to share information
            promptly and efficiently between (and within)
            organizations.&#8221; Shelby wants recentralization and more focus
            on co&ouml;peration. He wants a &#8220;central national level
            knowledge-compiling entity standing above and independent
            from the disputatious bureaucracies.&#8221; He thinks the
            intelligence service should be run by a small, highly
            cohesive group, and so he suggests that the F.B.I. be
            removed from the counterterrorism business entirely. The
            F.B.I., according to Shelby, is governed by<br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">deeply-entrenched individual
              mindsets that prize the production of evidence-supported
              narratives of defendant wrongdoing over the drawing of
              probabilistic inferences based on incomplete and
              fragmentary information in order to support
              decision-making. . . . Law enforcement organizations
              handle information, reach conclusions, and ultimately just
              think differently than intelligence organizations.
              Intelligence analysts would doubtless make poor policemen,
              and it has become very clear that policemen make poor
              intelligence analysts. <br>
            </div>
            <br>
            In his State of the Union Message, President George W. Bush
            did what Shelby wanted, and announced the formation of the
            Terrorist Threat Integration Center&#8212;a special unit combining
            the antiterrorist activities of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A.
            The cultural and organizational diversity of the
            intelligence business, once prized, is now despised. <br>
            <br>
            The truth is, though, that it is just as easy, in the wake
            of September 11th, to make the case for the old system.
            Isn&#8217;t it an advantage that the F.B.I. doesn&#8217;t think like the
            C.I.A.? It was the F.B.I., after all, that produced two of
            the most prescient pieces of analysis&#8212;the request by the
            Minneapolis office for a warrant to secretly search Zacarias
            Moussaoui&#8217;s belongings, and the now famous Phoenix memo. In
            both cases, what was valuable about the F.B.I.&#8217;s analysis
            was precisely the way in which it differed from the
            traditional &#8220;big picture,&#8221; probabilistic inference-making of
            the analyst. The F.B.I. agents in the field focussed on a
            single case, dug deep, and came up with an
            &#8220;evidence-supported narrative of defendant wrongdoing&#8221; that
            spoke volumes about a possible Al Qaeda threat.<br>
            <br>
            The same can be said for the alleged problem of rivalry.
            &#8220;The Cell&#8221; describes what happened after police in the
            Philippines searched the apartment that Ramzi Yousef shared
            with his co-conspirator, Abdul Hakim Murad. Agents from the
            F.B.I.&#8217;s counterterrorism unit immediately flew to Manila
            and &#8220;bumped up against the C.I.A.&#8221; As the old adage about
            the Bureau and the Agency has it, the F.B.I. wanted to
            string Murad up and the C.I.A. wanted to string him along.
            The two groups eventually worked together, but only because
            they had to. It was a relationship &#8220;marred by rivalry and
            mistrust.&#8221; But what&#8217;s wrong with this kind of rivalry? As
            Miller, Stone, and Mitchell tell us, the real objection of
            Neil Herman&#8212;the F.B.I.&#8217;s former domestic counterterrorism
            chief&#8212;to &#8220;working with the C.I.A. had nothing to do with
            procedure. He just didn&#8217;t think the Agency was going to be
            of any help in finding Ramzi Yousef. &#8216;Back then, I don&#8217;t
            think the C.I.A. could have found a person in a bathroom,&#8217;&#8221;
            Herman says. &#8220;&#8216;Hell, I don&#8217;t think they could have found the
            bathroom.&#8217;&#8221; The assumption of the reformers is always that
            the rivalry between the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. is essentially
            marital, that it is the dysfunction of people who ought to
            work together but can&#8217;t. But it could equally be seen as a
            version of the marketplace rivalry that leads to companies
            working harder and making better products.<br>
            <br>
            There is no such thing as a perfect intelligence system, and
            every seeming improvement involves a tradeoff. A couple of
            months ago, for example, a suspect in custody in Canada, who
            was wanted in New York on forgery charges, gave police the
            names and photographs of five Arab immigrants, who he said
            had crossed the border into the United States. The F.B.I.
            put out an alert on December 29th, posting the names and
            photographs on its Web site, in the &#8220;war on terrorism&#8221;
            section. Even President Bush joined in, saying, &#8220;We need to
            know why they have been smuggled into the country, what
            they&#8217;re doing in the country.&#8221; As it turned out, the suspect
            in Canada had made the story up. Afterward, an F.B.I.
            official said that the agency circulated the photographs in
            order to &#8220;err on the side of caution.&#8221; Our intelligence
            services today are highly sensitive. But this kind of
            sensitivity is not without its costs. As the political
            scientist Richard K. Betts wrote in his essay &#8220;Analysis,
            War, and Decision: Why Intelligence Failures Are
            Inevitable,&#8221;&#8220;Making warning systems more sensitive reduces
            the risk of surprise, but increases the number of false
            alarms, which in turn reduces sensitivity.&#8221; When we run out
            and buy duct tape to seal our windows against chemical
            attack, and nothing happens, and when the government&#8217;s
            warning light is orange for weeks on end, and nothing
            happens, we soon begin to doubt every warning that comes our
            way. Why was the Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor so
            unresponsive to signs of an impending Japanese attack?
            Because, in the week before December 7, 1941, they had
            checked out seven reports of Japanese submarines in the
            area&#8212;and all seven were false. Rosenhan&#8217;s psychiatrists used
            to miss the sane; then they started to see sane people
            everywhere. That is a change, but it is not exactly
            progress.<br>

            <big><big><big>I</big></big></big>n the wake of the Yom
            Kippur War, the Israeli government appointed a special
            investigative commission, and one of the witnesses called
            was Major General Zeira, the head of AMAN. Why, they asked,
            had he insisted that war was not imminent? His answer was
            simple: <br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">The Chief of Staff has to
              make decisions, and his decisions must be clear. The best
              support that the head of AMAN can give the Chief of Staff
              is to give a clear and unambiguous estimate, provided that
              it is done in an objective fashion. To be sure, the
              clearer and sharper the estimate, the clearer and sharper
              the mistake&#8212;but this is a professional hazard for the head
              of AMAN. <br>

            The historians Eliot A. Cohen and John Gooch, in their book
            &#8220;Military Misfortunes,&#8221; argue that it was Zeira&#8217;s certainty
            that had proved fatal: &#8220;The culpable failure of AMAN&#8217;s
            leaders in September and October 1973 lay not in their
            belief that Egypt would not attack but in their supreme
            confidence, which dazzled decision-makers. . . . Rather than
            impress upon the prime minister, the chief of staff and the
            minister of defense the ambiguity of the situation, they
            insisted&#8212;until the last day&#8212;that there would be no war,
            period.&#8221;<br>
            <br>
            But, of course, Zeira gave an unambiguous answer to the
            question of war because that is what politicians and the
            public demanded of him. No one wants ambiguity. Today, the
            F.B.I. gives us color-coded warnings and speaks of
            &#8220;increased chatter&#8221; among terrorist operatives, and the
            information is infuriating to us because it is so vague.
            What does &#8220;increased chatter&#8221; mean? We want a prediction. We
            want to believe that the intentions of our enemies are a
            puzzle that intelligence services can piece together, so
            that a clear story emerges. But there rarely is a clear
            story&#8212;at least, not until afterward, when some enterprising
            journalist or investigative committee decides to write one.
