                know philosophy&#8217;s major divisions, including
                epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics, and some of the
                puzzles that philosophers think about. Is the outside
                world as it appears to be? Does God exist? Are we free?
                How should we lead our lives? You will learn about and
                evaluate major thinkers' answers to questions like
                these. You will also enhance your critical thinking
                skills so that your beliefs can be better grounded in
                logic, deepened by an understanding of the issues at
                stake, and tempered with an appreciation of opposing

                  If it's not at least 200 words, try answering another
                  question until you've got at least 200 words total.

                  class. So, doing more than one passing response per

                  is turn in one per week and, in some weeks, turn in
                  more than one, and see to it you total 17 passing

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Academic integrity. </span>We

















                learn from others. So I expect words and ideas from
                other people (readings, classmates, me, research you do,
                etc.) to show up in your work. But we must acknowledge
                everyone who helped us. So, whenever others' words or
                ideas appear in your work, you must cite them whether
                you quote them or not. <br>
                <br>
                I take academic integrity very seriously and I expect
                you to. Often, cheating is unintended, but even then it
                is a serious offense and I may prosecute you. The
                minimum penalty is usually worse than turning in no work
                at all, and penalties can include failing the course,
                suspension, or expulsion. Much plagiarism is due to
                ignorance of the standards and requirements for
                documenting sources, so I urge you to:<br>

                  an act of contemplation, perhaps the only act in which
                  we allow ourselves to merge with the consciousness of

                  animating the waiting stillness of their language, but
                  they possess us also, filling us with thoughts and
                  observations, asking us to make them part of
                  ourselves.... In order for this to work, however, we

                assignments for this course typically consist of a

                material written by the book&#8217;s editor, Andrew Bailey.
                Bailey suggests you read the selection first, and then
