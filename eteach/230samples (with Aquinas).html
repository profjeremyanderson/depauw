                Nothing in this answer is false, but it's still not very
                good. It contains less information than is in the book
                (Pojman, 19), and much less than was on the board and

                          skepticism, subjectivism, and conventionalism
                          are different views about the basis of moral
                          rules--that is, about how moral rules get
                          their validity, if any.<br>
                          <br>
                          Moral skepticism admits that there are moral
                          rules, but it holds they have no basis, or
                          none we can know for sure. So, skepticism does
                          not consider any moral principles to be
                          binding (or "valid" as the book says). Moral
                          skepticism implies that ethics is a kind of
                          sham to the extent that it tries to convince
                          us that rules are justified.<br>
                          <br>
                          Unlike moral skepticism, subjectivism holds
                          that moral rules can be justified, and they
                          are justified by your personal decision or
                          belief. In other words, subjectivism holds
                          that an act is right only if you think it is;
                          otherwise it is not. <br>
                          <br>
                          Conventionalism also holds that moral rules
                          can be justified. Unlike subjectivism,
                          conventionalism holds that rules are justified
                          by culture: an act is right only if your
                          culture approves of it; otherwise not. <br>

                This shows a clear understanding that both moral
                skepticism and subjectivism are views about whether and
                how moral principles can be justified, and clearly
                states each view's position on the matter. <br>

                  resolving their dispute? What might it be? (What&#8217;s
                  most important here is to give me a sense of how
                  Aquinas would approach this matter.)"</span><br

                Here you are asked to take a sophisticated set of ideas
                from Aquinas and apply them in a hypothetical but
                possible situation. This is a dispute where Azzam and
                Becky dislike each other's behavior and this dislike is
                connected with moral rules of their respective cultures.<br>

                </span>This answer is not factually wrong, so I wouldn't
                give it a zero. But you could give at this answer based
                merely on knowing Aquinas was Christian, without ever
                doing the reading or paying attention in class. So the
                answer above is very poor.<br>

                        rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font size="-1">Based on
                          the reading we have, it&#8217;s hard to tell exactly
                          how Aquinas might resolve Azzam &amp; Becky&#8217;s
                          dispute. Aquinas gives us a universal moral
                          standard of natural law that might be used to
                          settle disputes between people from different
                          cultures. But it&#8217;s not clear that this
                          standard (at least what we have of it) tells
                          us what to do to settle this case.<br>
                          <br>
                          On one hand, Aquinas definitely thinks there
                          are some universal moral truths. There are
                          some precepts we can figure out by reason, and
                          anyone&#8217;s behavior may be judged by those
                          precepts. Moreover, any particular rule in a
                          given society may be evaluated by reference to
                          those precepts. Because of this, it appears
                          that for Aquinas there may be some way of
                          resolving this dispute--that is, some way we
                          can get beyond the unproductive head-butting
                          of subjectivism (which leaves us with &#8220;he said
                          vs. she said&#8221;) or conventionalism (which
                          leaves us with &#8220;his culture says vs. her
                          culture says&#8221;).&nbsp; <br>
                          <br>
                          More specifically, Aquinas says that we all
                          seek the good and that we are naturally
                          inclined towards some particular goods,
                          including social living (29). He says that
                          "whatever pertains to this inclination belongs
                          to the natural law: e.g., ...to avoid
                          offending those among whom one has to live"
                          (29). This means that natural law tells us to
                          do what will help us live socially, and that
                          this includes avoiding offense. Moreover, he
                          emphatically says that law always tells us to
                          seek the common good, not just our own private
                          good, because as members of society we are
                          like parts of a whole (23). Azzam and Becky
                          are offending each other, so we could at least
                          conclude that their dispute should not
                          continue, especially if it could lead to any
                          sort of social disruption. <br>
                          <br>
                          On the other hand, Aquinas allows that a given
                          moral rule--not one of the precepts of the law
                          of nature, but a man-made moral rule derived
                          from the precepts--may not apply in all
                          particular cases, as in his example of giving
                          weapons back (30). He says that the "first
                          principles" of morality are "altogether
                          unchangeable," but to apply them we derive
                          "secondary principles"--the particular rules
                          of our society--which might not always apply
                          (p. 30). He identifies two ways in which a
                          given rule may fail to apply universally.
                          First, it may apply in some societies but not
                          others. A modern example of this is the rule
                          of driving on the right side of the road.
                          Second, like the rule about giving back what
                          is held in trust, there may be circumstances
                          in which an exception must be made to a rule
                          that otherwise is generally legitimate. <br>
                          <br>
                          So Aquinas gives us a general approach to
                          discovering the universal moral law:
                          identifying first principles, then deriving
                          secondary principles from them which we can
                          then apply to particular situations. <br>
                          <br>
                          But given what is said in the readings and the
                          prompt, it is not clear how this might resolve
                          Azzam and Becky's disagreement. Is Azzam's
                          rule about women's public attire more clearly
                          justified by the precepts than Becky's, or
                          vice versa? Can we deduce from the precepts
                          some rule about how to adjudicate their
                          dispute? The answers to these questions are
                          not obvious. Perhaps it would be helpful if we
                          knew more. For example, if the dispute were
                          taking place in Saudi Arabia, Aquinas might
                          say that the potential for social disruption
                          and giving offence to others is lower if Becky
                          wears a veil, and that therefore she ought to
                          do so. </font> </td>

              </div>
              <br>
              <font size="-1">This answer does not say "Aquinas would
                say that Azzam and/or Becky should do X." But that's
                fine, because the answer gives reasons why it's hard to
                come to such a neat conclusion, and those reasons are
                grounded in the Aquinas reading. That's what the
                question is after: showing how Aquinas thinks about a
                situation. Remember Aquinas, like Aristotle, believes
                that ethics is an imprecise subject (Aquinas, 30).<br>
                <br>
                However, if your answer shows a way that Aquinas could
                resolve their dispute which is consistent with his
                general principles, that'd be great, too. <br>
                <br>
                Of course I wouldn't expect you to give this exact
                answer, nor would I expect you to quote Aquinas or give
                page numbers! I put them here to help you find the
