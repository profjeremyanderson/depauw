                    of us tend to be <span style="font-weight: bold;">realists

                      style="font-weight: bold;">really are</span> such
                    things as rocks, tables, and chairs, and that if our
                    beliefs about the world match the way it really is
                    then our beliefs are true; otherwise they are not.
                    However, for reasons I will explain below, if we
                    take realism seriously we find that perhaps most of
                    our ordinary beliefs about the world are false. This
                    may tempt us to reject realism and embrace
                    relativism--the belief that the world is how each
                    person or culture believes it to be, and that there
                    are no "objective" facts but rather only matters of
                    opinion. But relativism, too, runs into problems.
                    Hilary Putnam has offered an alternative to realism
                    and to relativism he calls <span
                      style="font-weight: bold;">internal realism</span>
                    and&nbsp; which, he argues, provides many of the
                    benefits of realism without running into certain
                    problems realism suffers from. In what follows I
                    will explain how Descartes and Berkeley are
                    realists, then briefly explain a problem with
                    realism, and then explain why we might not want to
                    embrace relativism as an alternative. My main
                    project in this paper then will be to explain the
                    core ideas of Putnam's internal realism, and the
                    main arguments he offers in favor of it and against
                    alternative views. </font></span><font

                    realism. </span>As different as they are, Descartes
                  and Berkeley have some ideas in common. One idea they
                  share--and which many of us tend to assume is true--is
                  this: that the way things are in the world is
                  independent of our beliefs, our interests, and so on.
                  If there is a cliff before me with a long drop into a
                  lake below, this is true whether I believe it or not,
                  or whether I want it to be true. I may believe with
                  all sincerity that the ground continues level ahead of
                  me and wholeheartedly wish to walk out on it, but if I
                  do I will nevertheless fall and get wet. Similarly,
                  there really is a desk in front of me on which my
                  computer sits as I type, whether I believe it or want
                  to believe it or not, a floor under my feet, air,
                  rocks, atoms, electrons, etc. Let's call this view of
                  the world <span style="font-weight: bold;">metaphysical



                    realism</span>, which Putnam calls "Realism with a
                  capital 'R'": there's a "real world" that exists "out
                  there," outside of our beliefs and interests. There's
                  a way things really are. Things have 'intrinsic'
                  properties, properties that are independent of
                  whatever we believe or feel about those things. Things
                  may also have 'dispositional' properties--for example,
                  the wall of my office appears to be white, but
                  whiteness isn't really in the wall; it's just that the
                  microscopic structure of the wall's surface (which is
                  an intrinsic property) tends to (i.e., is 'disposed
                  to') reflect light in a way that I perceive as white.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                  [3] It is obvious that Descartes is a metaphysical
                  realist, because he thinks that there are things like
                  towers and desks and paper that exist outside of him,
                  and that his beliefs about such things are true
                  insofar as they match how those things really are. In
                  Descartes we see it from the First Meditation: he
                  claims that some of his beliefs about the world have
                  been mistaken, and that it is possible all of them are
                  wrong. Think about it: these errors can only be
                  possible if the world is independent of his beliefs.
                  Descartes' entire project in the Meditations is to
                  find a way to bridge the gap between the ideas in his
                  mind and the world outside of his mind: to find a way
                  to tell with absolute certainty which of those ideas
                  are "veridical"--that is, which ideas match the way
                  the outside world really is. Also, according to
                  Descartes, the world outside of his mind is largely
                  material: there are solid, unthinking things outside
                  us, wholly independent of us.<br>

                    size="-1">[4] As for Berkeley, it may be tempting to
                    assume that he is not a metaphysical realist. After
                    all, doesn't he maintain that everything is "just
                    inside our minds"? If so, how can there be a world
                    "out there," independent of us? To see how Berkeley
                    is nevertheless a metaphysical realist, we need to
                    be clear about where "out there" is. Many of us tend
                    to automatically think like Descartes and assume
                    that "out there" means "out in the world of material
                    things." But if you look again at the definition of
                    metaphysical realism above, you'll see that "out
                    there" only means "outside of our beliefs and
                    interests." This includes "out in the material
                    world" (assuming there is one), but includes more
                    besides. Look inside your own mind, as Descartes did
                    in the Fourth Meditation, and notice that beliefs
                    and interests are separate from perceptions: it is
                    one thing for you to <span style="font-style:
                      italic;">perceive </span>an apple, and another
                    for you to <span style="font-style: italic;">believe




                    </span>the apple is real (as opposed to a
                    hallucination, say) or to <span style="font-style:
                      italic;">want </span>to eat it. So perceptions
                    are outside of our beliefs and interests, in the
                    sense that they are distinct from them. And Berkeley
                    maintains that the world simply consists of
                    perceptions given to us by God. Thus, Berkeley
                    maintains that the world is separate from our
                    beliefs and interests, and he is therefore a
                    metaphysical realist.</font></div>

                <div class="fst" style="font-family: Georgia;"><font
                    size="-1">[5] This becomes even clearer when we
                    notice that Berkeley plainly distinguishes between
                    what we believe about the world and how it actually
                    is. He insists on this distinction in PHK section
                    34: "There is a <span style="font-style: italic;">rerum



                      natura</span> [a way things are], and the
                    distinction between realities and chimeras
                    [illusions] retains its full force" even if we agree
                    with him that the heavens and the earth are nothing
                    but ideas in our minds. After all, what is Berkeley
                    trying to do in <span style="font-style: italic;">A
                      Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human
                      Knowledge</span> if not correct the erroneous
                    belief that material objects exist? Berkeley wrote
                    the book because he knows that many of us, when we
                    perceive an apple, believe that there is a material
                    object outside of our minds which is causing our
                    perception. He wants to convince us that this belief
                    is a silly mistake--it fails to match the way the
                    world really is. So to him there is a way the world
                    is, independently of our beliefs.<br>

                      problem with metaphysical realism: the ordinary
                      world no longer exists. </span>Although
                    metaphysical realism seems commonsensical to many of
                    us, it has its problems, one of which I will discuss
                    here. Let's go back to that apple we're perceiving.
                    Offhand, we tend to think of it as merely an apple,
                    a single object, sitting still on a table maybe. But
                    according to our best current scientific
                    theories--the theories we rely on to tell us what's
                    "really real" about the world--that's not right. Not
                    even close. The apple, like all material objects,
                    consists of an astounding number of molecules too
                    small to see, which themselves consist of atoms,
                    which themselves consist of protons, electrons, and
                    so on, and these tiny particles are moving through
                    space at incredible speeds. The apple really is a
                    collection of tiny particles in motion within vast
                    reaches (proportionately speaking) of empty space.
                    Thus, our belief that the apple is a single, solid
                    object sitting still is just plain false. The apple,
                    as we ordinarily perceive it, does not really exist.
                    Neither do tables, chairs, floors, buildings, or any
                    of the other ordinary objects which we usually think
                    of as the real, solid objects around us. If we take
                    metaphysical realism seriously, we--in effect--lose
                    the world as we ordinarily experience it; that world
                    of tables and chairs just isn't real, and our
                    ordinary, commonsense beliefs about tables and
                    chairs are false.&nbsp; This seems wrong.<br>

                      relativism</span>--sometimes called
                    subjectivism--which says that truth is relative to
                    each individual: "that is a table" is true (or
                    rather "true for you") if and only if you believe
                    it. Another form is <span style="font-weight:
                      bold;">cultural relativism</span>, which says that
                    "that is a table" is true within a given culture if
                    and only if the members of that culture believe it.</font></div>

                    [8] Relativism appeals to a lot of people when they
                    first meet it. It conforms to our sense that people
                    may legitimately disagree about what is true and
                    what is real. We may believe that our beliefs are,
                    after all, just our beliefs, and that we have no
                    special access to the truth that entitles us to say
                    that those who disagree with us are mistaken.
                    Metaphysical realism cannot tolerate such
                    differences; it says there's one true way the world
                    is and whoever disagrees with it is just flat wrong.
                    But relativism tolerates differences of opinion; it
                    says all opinions are equally OK. This fits well
                    with the commonly-held belief that people are
                    essentially equal. According to relativism, we're
                    all equally entitled to our opinions, because
                    they're all equally true.</font></div>

                    [9] However, both individual and cultural relativism
                    run into serious problems. For example, what if you,
                    or the members of your culture, say "that island
                    belongs to our nation" and I, or the members of my
                    culture, say "no, that island belongs to us"? There
                    seems to be no way to settle our disagreement; we're
                    left having to say that both cultures have an equal,
                    valid claim to the same land. We could ask someone
                    to serve as judge in a dispute, but that person
                    would merely be expressing <span style="font-style:
                      italic;">their </span>opinion, and there would be
                    no more reason to respect their judgment than to
                    believe anyone else. That seems lame, and it seems
                    to fly in the face of our experience. To judge from
                    our behavior, we <span style="font-style: italic;">do


                    </span>think that some people's opinions carry more
                    weight than others. When you're seriously ill, don't
                    you see a doctor rather than asking just anybody for
                    medical help? If relativism were true, the opinion
                    of any stranger on the street--some muttering drunk
                    who happens to be passing by, for example--would be
                    as just as good as any doctor's diagnosis. If
                    relativism were true, there would be no reason to
                    ask your professor for help figuring out what a
                    difficult part of a book means; any five-year-old's
                    opinion--or yours, for that matter--would be just as
                    good as the professor's. After all, if something is
                    true if you believe it to be true, then whatever
                    opinion you happen to form, about anything
                    whatsoever, is true, just as true as what anyone
                    else thinks.</font></div>

                    [10] Relativism says that this is how things are,
                    but most of us think--or at least behave as if--it's
                    nutty. Every time we consult an expert, it is
                    because we think some people know better. And we
                    generally think they know better because they have
                    studied the matter at hand (be it medicine,
                    literature, law, or whatever) and found out more
                    about it than we have. But to "find out more about
                    it" presupposes that <span style="font-style:
                      italic;">there is something to be found</span>--some


                    facts to be discovered, that are not merely matters
                    of opinion. In other words, we behave like realists,
                    who believe there is a real world and that by
                    careful study some people have learned more about
                    certain aspects of it than we have, and we consult
                    them for their expertise. And an individual's or
                    culture's refusal to believe the cliff is there is
                    not going to stop them from falling into the lake if
                    they walk over it, is it? When you get right down to
                    it, relativism is hard to buy. As much as we may
                    value tolerance and equality, we don't generally
                    believe that all individuals' or cultures' opinions
                    are equally true.</font></div>

                    view of reality and truth which provides an
                    alternative to metaphysical realism and cultural
                    relativism by insisting that 'conceptual relativity'
                    and realism are compatible, and that thus we can be
                    realists about tables and chairs and about electrons
                    and space-time regions etc., and not reduce the
                    former to the latter (MFR pp. 1, 16, 17). In favor
                    of this Putnam argues that we cannot talk about
                    "what is really there" in the world apart from our
                    conceptual schemes and interests (MFR 33, 37-39; RR
                    114); but that at the same time what is true or
                    false is not merely a matter of convention as
                    cultural relativists maintain it is (MFR 20). There
                    is more to Putnam's view than this; internal realism
                    is key to his views on causation, intentionality and
                    reference, for example. But for brevity I will

                    seems to be "three." But Putnam points out that this

                      scheme </span>through which we view the world
                    (MFR 32-3). In this case, the answer "three" is the
                    answer we arrive at <span style="font-style:
                      italic;">given </span>a conceptual scheme such as
                    Rudolph Carnap's, which sees x1, x2, and x3 as
                    logical atoms. But Putnam notes that this conceptual
                    scheme is not the only one, and that another scheme
                    could yield another, and equally valid, verdict. As
                    an example of such an alternative he uses the scheme
                    of some Polish logicians, who believe that for every
                    two particulars there is an object which is their
                    sum (MFR 18). When this logical doctrine is applied

                    that even when it comes to the most basic notions we
                    have concerning things in the world--e.g., what it
                    is to be an "object," and whether something
                    "exists"--there is not one absolute meaning for the
                    terms we use. Rather, there are a variety of
                    different meanings we might choose between (MFR 19,
                    RR 114). How we employ our terms reflects our choice
                    of conceptual schemes, and this, in turn, affects
                    how we view the world, even with regard to the most
                    "objective"-seeming aspect of it: what is an object
                    and what is not. There is nothing about the <span
                      style="font-style: italic;">world </span>which
                    dictates the choice of the Carnapian scheme over the
                    Polish logicians' scheme, or vice versa; neither of
                    them is "more right" than the other, let alone the
                    "one true version" of reality (MFR 35, RR 114-115).
                    Yet if we assume Carnap's scheme, the statement
                    'there are more than four objects' is false, while
                    under the Polish logicians' scheme it is true,
                    concerning the same world. Thus, what is real about

                    the most basic questions concerning the world,
                    including questions concerning what constitutes an
                    object, then the notion of an "object existing
                    independently of our conceptual schemes" is
                    unintelligible. It makes no sense at all. And in
                    that case, the distinction between the properties
                    things have "in themselves" (their intrinsic
                    properties) and non-intrinsic properties breaks
                    down, for we are unable to talk intelligibly about
                    intrinsic properties (MFR 36). But without this
                    distinction, how can Putnam call himself a realist?
                    Doesn't realism entail such a separation between our
                    minds and language on the one hand and the "world

                      with Realism with a capital 'R.' </span>To take
                    the first part first: "commonsense" realism is the
                    view the there really are "ordinary middle-sized
                    objects" such as tables, chairs, and ice cubes--that
                    in thinking of such things as single objects rather
                    than as, say, collections of particles, we are not
                    making a mistake (MFR 3, 16). And Putnam argues that
                    the dichotomy between intrinsic and non-intrinsic
                    properties is at the root of a line of thinking that
                    ends up denying the existence of such ordinary
                    objects (MFR 4). Besides the intrinsic/non-intrinsic
                    distinction, the chief elements of this line of
                    thinking are the beliefs that only the objects
                    described by science really exist, and that other
                    properties are but projections of our minds (MFR

                    the properties an ordinary object is held to have
                    "in itself" are those which are scientifically
                    describable (say, in terms of analytic geometry or
                    physics). But Putnam notes that there is no
                    scientific account in the offing which fully
                    explains the phenomena of color and solidity (MFR
                    5-6, 7-8). Thus these qualities--which, Putnam
                    points out, make up our conception of typical
                    commonsense objects--along with most of an object's
                    other qualities (MFR 12) end up in the category of
                    projections of our minds. The gist of Putnam's
                    argument seems to be that if only those qualities
                    described by science really belong to an object, and
                    there is no scientific description of color or
                    solidity or other dispositional properties, then
                    these properties are not really in the objects
                    themselves. And if what isn't in objects themselves
                    is a projection (i.e., the result of thinking the
                    object has properties it does not have, but which we
                    imagine, without being conscious of doing so; MFR
                    11), then dispositional properties are projections
                    of our minds. And to explain dispositions in terms
                    of projection is to explain "just about every
                    feature of the commonsense world in terms of <span

                    [20] Think of it this way. If we try to be
                    thoroughgoing metaphysical realists, we need to
                    distinguish what is real about the world from what
                    we believe, since metaphysical realism holds that
                    beliefs and reality are independent. To discover
                    what is real, we rely on our best scientific
                    theories. They tell us that what is real about, say,
                    a sheet of paper, is that it is a collection of tiny
                    charged particles whizzing around through space-time
                    regions, and that is all. If that's all that's real
                    about the paper, then the only thing to say about
                    the rest of what we believe about it--that it's
                    white, smooth, handy for writing on, etc.--is that
                    these must be things that we "project" with our
                    minds. But this is to say that most of what we
                    ordinarily experience about the world is a mere
                    fabrication of our minds'. It isn't real, and,
                    strictly speaking, such beliefs as "that is a
                    table," "this paper is white," "terrorism is wrong,"
                    and so on are false, because they do not match
                    anything that our best current scientific theories
                    find "out there" in the world.</font></div>

                    [21] This, says Putnam, is a paradoxical result,
                    because it denies the reality of the commonsense
                    world, "the world we experience ourselves as living
                    in" (MFR 12). Instead of championing our sense that
                    "<span style="font-style: italic;">of course</span>
                    there are tables and chairs, and any philosophy that
                    tells us that there really aren't...is more than
                    slightly crazy" (MFR 3-4), Realism with a capital
                    'R'--metaphysical realism--ends up crazily asserting
                    that it is false that there are tables and chairs
                    and ice cubes. And the root cause of this is
                    metaphysical realism's employment of the notion of
                    intrinsic properties and the resultant dichotomy
                    between intrinsic and non-intrinsic properties (MFR
                    8-9). Metaphysical realism says that there are
                    properties an object really has independently of our
                    beliefs--intrinsic properties. But Putnam's
                    conceptual relativity argument (the one with the
                    world containing x1, x2, and x3) showed that the
                    very idea of an object depends on our beliefs, and
                    that therefore the notion of intrinsic properties is
                    nonsense. The intrinsic vs. non-intrinsic dichotomy
                    should be abandoned, and reference to the notions of
                    an intrinsic property and of an object "in itself"
                    should be dropped (MFR 36).</font></div>

                  [22] Next, to show that giving up the
                  intrinsic/non-intrinsic dichotomy is not tantamount to
                  relativism, Putnam is careful to point out that while

                    people agrees to follow a Carnapian scheme which
                    does not recognize the sum of two particulars as an
                    object. They are neither right nor wrong to do so,
                    since this is simply one perfectly good scheme among
                    others. But if they then unanimously declare there
                    to be (say) four objects in the hypothetical world,
                    their agreement on the matter does nothing to
                    vindicate them because it is simply a fact that,
                    given the Carnapian way of counting objects, there
                    are only three objects in the world. (And likewise,
                    given the Polish logician's conceptual scheme, it
                    would be true that there are seven objects.) This is
                    what distances Putnam's conceptual relativity from
                    cultural relativism. Cultural relativism says that
                    if we agree that there are four, or seven, or twenty
                    objects, that's how many there are, simply because
                    we agree it is so. Relativism is objectionable,
                    Putnam points out, because it implies that "there is
                    no truth to be found... 'true' is just a name for
                    what a bunch of people can agree on" (MFR 17-18).
                    But conceptual relativity avoids this problem
                    because the choice (or assumption) of a conceptual
                    scheme only determines how one goes about finding an
                    answer--in this case, how one counts 'objects'--but
                    does not determine what the answer is. The answer is
                    to be discovered, not agreed upon.<br>

                    the charge that he is not a realist--his claim that
                    his view does not lead to the idea that every
                    conceptual scheme is as good as any other--is not
                    explicitly supported in the text. It seems to me
                    that there are at least two arguments open to him,
                    however. One is simply that his view provides no
                    particular reason to believe that all conceptual
                    schemes are equally good. The fact that there are
                    different schemes we may choose from, and that more
                    than one of them may be legitimate in a given case,
                    does not of itself imply that none are better than
                    others. There is simply insufficient data to claim
                    that all conceptual schemes are equally good.
                    Secondly, given his evident sympathy for pragmatism,
                    I speculate that Putnam would think that some
                    conceptual schemes are more useful than others. If
                    so, then even if there's nothing about the world
                    which dictates the choice of any particular scheme
                    to us, we might still have a basis for choosing
                    between schemes. We just have no grounds for
                    declaring one scheme to be the "one true" scheme.<br>

                      of internal realism. </span>Putnam cannot be a
                    realist if "realist" means "holds the view that (at
                    least some) objects exist independently of our minds
                    and language," as it traditionally has. But as we
                    have seen, Putnam denies the intelligibility of the
                    notion of objects existing so independently. He
                    rejects that notion because it ultimately undermines
                    the belief that commonsense objects are real. His
                    internal realism asserts that, since even our basic
                    notions of object and existence are defined in
                    relation to our conceptual schemes, there is no
                    possible description of the facts which is
                    completely independent of such schemes or, as he
                    more conveniently calls them, "versions."
                    Nevertheless, the versions we choose only determine
                    how we look at the world, not what we then find in
                    it. When I assume the "commonsense" version, I see
                    the world as populated with objects such as tables
                    and chairs, but it is not merely the choice of
                    versions which tells me I am sitting on a chair now
                    or that the chair is blue; these are facts I
                    discover. If, on the other hand, I assume the
                    physicist's version, I see the world as populated by
                    congeries of electrons in regions of space-time; but
                    whether the electrons are there and what they are
                    doing are not a function of my conceptual scheme.
                    They too are facts to be discovered, which exist
                    independently of my judgments concerning them: if I
                    judge that there are none beneath me at this moment
                    or that they are in a liquid state, I judge wrongly.
                    This independence of facts from our judgment (as
                    opposed to the independence of facts from all our
                    mental activities) is what constitutes Putnam's
                    realism. On the internal realist view there are no
                    facts, objects, or properties independent of our
                    conceptual schemes (to talk of them "is to talk of
                    nothing"; MFR 36); but, given a conceptual scheme,
                    the facts are not chosen but found, or not found, as
                    the case may be.</font></div>

                    [25] This lends a certain sense to Putnam's slogan
                    that "the mind and the world jointly make up the
                    mind and the world" (MFR 1). According to the
                    realist, the world "makes up the mind" in the sense
                    that it is purely by reference to the world that we
                    can tell whether the beliefs in our minds are
                    correct; the way the world is, is the sole arbiter
                    of truth. On the other hand, according to the
                    relativist the mind "makes up the world" and that is
                    that; the world is whatever the mind (or minds, in
                    cultural relativism) say it is. But on Putnams's
                    view, both of these are partly right. To him, the
                    mind "makes up the world" in the sense that it is
                    our conceptual schemes which determine how we make
                    such basic judgments as, in the example of the
                    Carnapian world, what constitutes an "object" and
                    what "exists." But the world "makes up the mind" in
                    the sense that once we have assumed a conceptual
                    scheme, when we correctly make up our minds about,
                    say, how many objects there are, it is on the basis
                    of how things really are when viewed from the
                    standpoint of that conceptual scheme--not because we
                    "project" it or agree on it.</font></div>

                    modern science, accounts for the fact that the
                    object beneath me is both a chair and a collection
                    of electrons by reducing the former to the latter.
                    But this, Putnam argues, leaves the chair in an <span

                    status--that of a mere mental projection--which it
                    does not deserve. Putnam maintains that the

                    different conceptual schemes involved, and neither
                    scheme is "truer" than the other. The belief that
                    there is some pre-structured or self-structured
                    Reality is an illusion; and so, then, is the belief
                    that correspondence to such a Reality is the ground
                    of truth. There is, then, no way to justify the
                    choice of one scheme or another by claiming that one
                    "fits reality better."<br>

                    </span>Internal realism is Putnam's attempt to avoid
                    what he considers to be the pitfalls of metaphysical
                    realism on the one hand and radical cultural
                    relativism on the other, while taking key elements
                    from both. In common with metaphysical realism,
                    internal realism holds that there are things "out
                    there," and that the truth is not simply legislated
                    by us. And in common with relativism, internal
                    realism holds that our assumptions and interests
                    make a decisive contribution to our view of the
                    world.</font></div>
