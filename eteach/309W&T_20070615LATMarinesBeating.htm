          <p>CAMP PENDLETON — A Marine corporal, testifying Saturday at
            the murder trial of a buddy, said that Marines in his unit
            began routinely beating Iraqis after being ordered by
            officers to "crank up the violence level."</p>
          <p>Cpl. Saul H. Lopezromo said Marines in his platoon,
            including the defendant, Cpl. Trent D. Thomas, were angry
            when officers criticized them as not being as tough as other
            Marine platoons.</p>

        <div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img
            src="/images/pixel.gif" alt="" height="1" width="1"></div>
        <div id="mod-a-body-after-first-para" style=""
          class="mod-latarticlesarticletext mod-articletext"><!-- Module starts: a-body-after-first-para (ArticleText) -->
          <p>"We're all hard-chargers, we're not there to mess around,
            so we took it as an insult," Lopezromo said.</p>
          <p>Within weeks of allegedly being scolded, seven Marines and
            a Navy corpsman went out late one night to find and kill a
            suspected insurgent in the village of Hamandiya near the Abu
            Ghraib prison. The Marines and corpsman were from 2nd
            Platoon, Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 5th Regiment.</p>
          <p>Lopezromo said their target was known to his neighbors as
            the "prince of jihad" and had been arrested several times,
            only to be released by the Iraqi legal system.</p>
          <p>Unable to find their target, the Marines and corpsman
            dragged another man from his house, fatally shot him, and
            then planted an AK-47 assault rifle near the body to make it
            look like he had been killed in a shootout, according to
            court testimony.</p>
          <p>Four Marines and the corpsman, initially charged with
            murder in the April 2006 killing, have pleaded guilty to
            reduced charges and been given jail sentences ranging from
            10 months to eight years. Thomas, 25, from St. Louis,
            pleaded guilty but withdrew his plea and is the first
            defendant to go to court-martial.</p>
          <p>"We were told to crank up the violence level," said
            Lopezromo, who testified for the defense. He indicated that
            during daily patrols the Marines became much rougher with
            Iraqis. Asked by a juror to explain, he said, "We beat
            people, sir."</p>
          <p>Lopezromo said he believed that officers knew of the
            beatings, and he suggested that the order to get tough
            soured him on the Marine Corps.</p>
          <p>Lopezromo, who was not part of the squad on its late-night
            mission, said he saw nothing wrong in what Thomas and the
            others did.</p>
          <p>"I don't see it as an execution, sir," he told the judge.
            "I see it as killing the enemy."</p>
          <p>He added that Marines, in effect, consider all Iraqi men as
            part of the insurgency. "Because of the way they live, the
            clans, they're all in it together," he said.</p>
          <p>In August, Lopezromo and two other Marines were charged
            with assaulting an Iraqi two weeks before the killing that
            led to charges against Thomas and the others. Charges
            against all three were dropped.</p>
          <p>Thomas' attorneys have portrayed him as suffering from
            post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury
            from his combat duty in Fallouja in 2004. Also, they have
            sought to convince the jury that Thomas believed he was
            following a lawful order to get tougher with suspected
            insurgents.</p>
          <p>Prosecution witnesses testified that Thomas shot the
            52-year-old Iraqi at point-blank range after he had already
            been shot by other Marines and was lying on the ground.</p>
          <p>Lopezromo said a procedure called "dead-checking" was
            routine. If Marines entered a house where a man was wounded,
            instead of checking to see whether he needed medical aid,
            they shot him to make sure he was dead, he testified.</p>
          <p>"If somebody is worth shooting once, they're worth shooting
            twice," he said.</p>
          <p>Marines are taught "dead-checking" in boot camp, the School
            of Infantry at Camp Pendleton, and the pre-deployment
            training at Twentynine Palms called Mojave Viper, he said.</p>
          <p>Other Marines testified that Thomas was emotionally shaken
            by the deaths of Marines during the fighting in Fallouja in
            late 2004. After the death of Lance Cpl. George Payton, "he
            broke down and cried, he was angry, the usual effect when
            you lose a friend," Staff Sgt. Gage Coduto said.</p>
          <p>Coduto said many Marines had difficulty adjusting to a
            change in the of rules of engagement from the Fallouja
            battle to places such as Hamandiya.</p>
          <p>"It took a lot of patience for guys to bring it down a
            notch," he said.</p>
          <p>The jury comprises three officers and six enlisted
            personnel, all of whom have served in Iraq. The trial
            resumes Monday.</p>
