            </font><font face="Georgia"><b>Questions for exam 1, on
                Descartes (Monday September 18)</b><font size="-1"><br>
              </font></font>
            <blockquote><font face="Georgia" size="-1">1. What is
                Descartes's explanation for why our opinions differ
                (Discourse, 1)? Why does that imply, to Descartes, that
                the right method (i.e., following the right path, going
                in the correct order) is very important? (It's helpful
                to consider what Descartes says about opinions that are
                disputed, 4, and how many truths there are about any
                matter, 10.)<br>
                <br>
                2. How does Descartes argue that it is important, after
                learning about others' opinions, to work <span
                  style="text-decoration: line-through;">on your own</span>
                by yourself (Discourse, 5-6)? <br>
                <br>
                3. Descartes describes following his method as being
                "like a man walking alone in the dark" (Discourse, 8).
                How is it like that? Still, how much knowledge does
                Descartes believe he can find by proceeding his way, in
                small steps, slowly and carefully (8, 9)? <br>
                <br>
                4. State the two rules of Descartes's Method of Doubt
                (M1, 1). Explain how he thinks it will help him achieve
                his goal of finding knowledge that is "stable and likely
                to last" (M1, 1). <br>
                <br>
                5. State Descartes's Dream Doubt argument (M1, 1-2) and
                his Defective Nature Doubt argument (M1, 2). Why does
                Descartes think he needs to "suppose that some
                malicious, powerful, cunning demon" is deceiving him
                (M1, 3), despite the fact that he has shown all his old
                beliefs are doubtful "on the basis of powerful and well
                thought-out reasons" (M1, 2)? <br>
                <br>
                6. In M2 Descartes claims to prove that he exists (4),
                and that he is a thinking thing (4-6). How does he argue
                for each? What does he mean by a "thinking thing" (M2,
                5-6)? <br>
                <br>
                7. Why does Descartes believe he must prove God exists
                (M3, 9-10)? <br>
                <br>
                8. When Descartes says that some ideas "contain within
                themselves more representative reality" than others (M3,
                11), what does he mean by an idea's "representative
                reality"? Why do ideas of substances have more
                representative reality than ideas of modes (or
                qualities)? (Class notes and my September 4 <a
                  target="_blank"
                  href="https://moodle.depauw.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=434497">Announcement</a>
                email may be helpful here.) <br>
                <br>
                9. How does Descartes argue, in the Third Meditation,
                that God exists (M3, 12-14; Phil 216,&nbsp; 9/6/2023)? <br>
                <br>
                10. How does Descartes argue, in the Fourth Meditation,
                that God would not deceive him (M4, 18)? How does this
                present "one difficulty" for Descartes (M4, 18)?<br>
                <br>
                11. Descartes claims that his intellect is limited but
                his will is unlimited (M4, 19). How does he use this to
                show that any errors are his own fault, and that he can
                avoid errors (M4, 20-1)? <br>
                <br>
                12. In the Fifth Meditation, Descartes examines his
                ideas of geometric figures like triangles (M5, 23-4).
                What does he conclude from this (24)? How does he use
                that to argue that God exists (M5, 24-5)? <br>
                <br>
                13. In the Sixth Meditation, Descartes argues that mind
                and body are "really distinct" (M6, 29). What does he
                mean by "really distinct"? How does he argue that mind
                and body are really distinct (29; Phil 216, 9/13/2023)?
                <br>
                <br>
                14. What is the "mind/body problem"? How does this
                problem arise from Descartes's argument that mind and
                body are really distinct (cf. M6, 29)? Identify two
                solutions to the mind/body problem <span

                  16. Explain why Leibniz thinks monads have no size or
                  shape, and cannot be naturally created or destroyed.
                  Why does he think a monad cannot be altered by
                  anything outside itself (except God)?<br>
                  &nbsp;<br>
                  17. If the universe is made of monads, each of which
                  cannot be changed by any other monads, what accounts
                  for the diversity and change that we see in the
                  universe, according to Leibniz? (You might give an
                  example of something like walking to lunch, or
                  throwing a ball, to illustrate.)<br>
                  &nbsp;<br>
                  18. What is "pre-established harmony" (or
                  "concomitance")? How does Leibniz's theory of
                  pre-established harmony account for the fact that
                  things appear to interact? Why does Leibniz say that
                  every monad is a mirror of the entire universe?<br>
                  <br>
                  19. Explain Leibniz's reasons for saying that ours is
                  the best possible world (see esp. <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">Discourse on Metaphysics</span>
                  secs. 1-5, pp. 1-3). Explain how he uses the example
                  of Judas to argue that the universe is better with
                  some evil in it (DM sec. 30, 21).<br>
                  <br>
                  20. Suppose you are standing outside looking at a
                  tree. Explain how Leibniz's account of your sensing
                  the tree differs from Descartes's account. Explain why
                  Leibniz would say Descartes's account must be wrong.
                  What does Leibniz's account imply about which of our
                  ideas are innate? <br>
                  <br>
                  21. Explain what the problem of free will is. How does
                  God's foreknowledge seem to imply we are not free
                  (Phil 216, 10/2/2023)? How does Leibniz argue that,
                  even though God knows what we will do, we are still
                  free (<span style="font-style: italic;">Dialogue on

                22. Lecture discussed the influence of Euclidean
                geometry on Early Modern Philosophers (Phil 216,
                10/6/2023). How does Euclid-style reasoning show up in
                Descartes (<span style="font-style: italic;">Discourse</span>,
                9; <span style="font-style: italic;">Meditations</span>)
                and Leibniz (esp. <span style="font-style: italic;">Monadology</span>)?























                How does Spinoza differ, especially from Descartes?<br>
                <br>
                23. Lecture discussed how Spinoza's views differ
                radically from others' (Phil 216, 10/6/2023; cf.
                Spinoza, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ethics</span>,
                Appendix, 18). Discuss how Spinoza differs regarding (a)
                whether God is separate from the world, (b) whether God
                is "personal," (c) how many substances there are, and
                (d) whether we are free. <br>
                <br>
                24. Give Spinoza's definitions of these terms:
                "substance" (D3), "attribute" (D4), "mode" (D5), and
                "God" (D6). It's OK to paraphrase them if you don't
                recall Spinoza's exact words, but strive to express the
                same meaning. <br>
                <br>
                25. Explain Spinoza's argument for why there cannot be
                two or more substances with the same attribute (P5). <br>
                <br>
                26. Lecture discussed the three traditional types of
                arguments that God exists (Phil 216, 10/11/2023). Define
                each of the three. Then, explain Spinoza's argument that
                God exists (P11). <br>
                <br>
                27. Suppose Spinoza's proof that God exists is sound.
                Explain why, then, God would have to be the only
                substance (i.e., why P14 is true).&nbsp; <br>
                <br>
                28. Discuss the implications of God being the only
                substance (Phil 216, 10/23/2023; Spinoza Notes).
                Specifically, how does this view imply that traditional
                theistic beliefs are mistaken? How does it provide a
                different sort of solution to the mind/body problem than
                Descartes or Leibniz does? <br>
                <br>
                29. Spinoza says "Things could not have been produced by
                God in any way or in any order other than that in which
                they have been produced" (P33, p. 15). How does Spinoza
                argue for this claim?<br>
                <br>
                30. In the Appendix, Spinoza wants to dispose of
                prejudices that keep us from grasping his views, and
                says those prejudices all come from one false but
                "common supposition" (p. 18). What is that supposition?
                Where does he say it comes from (pp. 18-19)? In class,
                we identified some prejudices and superstitions Spinoza
                wants to free us from; what were they (Phil 216,
                10/25/2023)?<br>

                  discussed Rationalism and Empiricism (10/30/2023).
                  What are the main features of each of them? In what
                  ways does Locke exemplify Empiricism?<br>
                  <br>
                  32. Locke argues that there are no innate ideas (<span
                    style="font-style: italic;">Essay </span>I.ii).
                  Explain his argument for this claim. Then, explain at
                  least one problem with Locke's argument against innate
                  ideas. (For example, why might Descartes object to
                  Locke's argument?)<br>
                  <br>
                  33. Locke says we get our ideas from experience
                  (II.i.2). What are the two kinds of experience
                  (II.i.2-4)? According to Locke, what are the four ways
                  simple ideas can get into our minds (II.iii.1)? Give
                  an example for each way (</font></font><font
                face="Georgia"><font size="-1">II.iii - II.vii)</font></font><font
                face="Georgia"><font size="-1">.<br>
                  <br>
                  34. According to Locke, what is a quality
                  (II.viii.7-8)? What is the difference between primary
                  and secondary qualities (II.viii.9-23, but especially
                  II.viii.15 and 23)? What "common opinion" is Locke
                  trying to correct with his primary/secondary quality
                  distinction (II.viii.7)? Give two examples showing
                  that the common opinion is partly wrong. <br>
                  <br>
                  35. Explain what the following are, according to
                  Locke: perception (II.ix.1-2); retention (both kinds)
                  (II.x.1-2); discerning (II.xi.1); comparing (II.xi.4);
                  composition (II.xi.6); and abstraction (II.xi.9). Pick
                  any one of them and explain why Locke thinks it is
                  important. <br>
                  <br>
                  36. How does Locke define "will" and "free" (II.xxi.5,
                  7)? Given his definitions of those, explain why Locke
                  thinks "Is man's will free or not?" is an absurd
                  question (II.xxi, especially II.xxi.14). <br>
                  <br>
                  37. How does Locke say we get the idea of a substance
                  (II.xxiii.1-2)? Why does this imply that we can never
                  sense a substance? In class it was pointed out that
                  Locke's discussion of substance seems to conflict with
                  his accounts of how we know things and his account of
                  language. How so? <br>
                  <br>
                  38. Locke says knowledge is a kind of perception; a
                  perception of what (IV.1.2)? What are the four
                  different sorts of knowledge (IV.I.3-7)? For each
                  kind, give an example. What are the three degrees of
                  knowledge (IV.II.1-2, 14)? Again, for each kind, give
                  an example.<br>
                  <br>
                  39. How does Locke demonstrate that God exists (IV.x)?
                  Explain his argument, and identify at least one
                  problem with it. (Since Locke's argument for an
                  eternal being <span style="font-style: italic;">existing









                  </span>is essentially Aquinas's Third Way, it's fine
                  to use Aquinas for that. But be sure to include how
                  Locke argues that God is also "most powerful" and
                  "most knowing," IV.x.4-5.)<br>
                  <br>
                  40. According to Locke, why are general terms
                  important (III.iii.1-4)? How do general terms get
                  their meaning (III.iii.6)? Using an example from our
                  Locke text or the portions of Locke quoted by

                first raised a dust," and then complained they can't see
                (3 Intro). How did they go wrong? Specifically, explain
                why Berkeley thinks we cannot have the sort of abstract
                ideas Locke says we need, using one of his examples (9
                Intro, 10 Intro, 13 Intro). What is Berkeley's account

                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">42. Berkeley's first
                  sentence in section 1 is, "Anyone who surveys the
                  objects of human knowledge will easily see that they
                  are all ideas," and he denies that we can have an idea
                  of mind (1, 27, etc.). How, then, do we know that mind
                  exists (26)? How does Berkeley describe this
                  knowledge, if it's not of an idea (27, 142)? Finally,
                  identify a problem with Berkeley's argument for mind.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  43. How does Berkeley argue that, even if matter
                  existed, we could never know it (18, 19)? In other
                  words, how does he argue that (a) sensation alone does
                  not show matter exists, (b) there is no good deductive
                  argument that matter causes sensations, and (c) there
                  is no good inductive argument that matter causes
                  sensations? <br>
                  <br>
                  44. If matter does not cause our sensations, what
                  does? In other words, how does Berkeley argue that God
                  exists (29-30; 146)? Explain in as much detail as you
                  can what features of our sensations point to God's
                  being their cause, according to Berkeley. Lastly,
                  identify one problem with Berkeley's argument for God.

                  <br>
                  45. How do substance dualists like Descartes and Locke
                  think we know about other minds (that is, other
                  people's minds)? How does Berkeley think we do
                  (145-7)? Discuss how Ockham's Razor might favor
                  Berkeley's explanation -- and how it might favor the
                  dualists' explanation. Which do you favor, and why? </span><br

                46. Explain why Hume thinks that the second, "accurate
                and abstruse" kind of philosophy is </font><font
                style="font-family: Georgia;" size="-1">"the inevitable

                4). Then, explain some of why Hume believes it is
                valuable nevertheless. To do that, explain any of these:
                (a) why Hume says it is a benefit for "every art or
                profession" (4); (b) how it helps free us from
                "superstition and bad philosophy" (5); or (c) why Hume
                says there is value in understanding our "mental
                geography" (5).</font><font size="-1"><br>
                <br>
                47. Explain how Hume distinguishes "impressions" from
                "ideas" (<span style="font-style: italic;">Enquiry</span>,
                section 2, 7-8). How does he argue that "all our
                ideas...are copies of our impressions" (section 2, 8-9)?
                Explain why he thinks understanding the distinction
                between impressions and ideas (and that the latter come
                from the former) can be helpful for resolving
                philosophical disputes (section 2, 9)?<br>
                <br>
                48. Explain what Hume means when he says our "ideas are
                obviously inter-connected" (<span style="font-style:
                  italic;">Enquiry</span>, section 3, 10). Hume claims
                there are "only three factors connecting ideas with one
                another" (10); identify each factor. For each, give an
                example and explain why it is an example of that factor.
                <br>
                <br>
                49. Hume says, "All the objects of human reason or
                enquiry fall naturally into two kinds" (<span
                  style="font-style: italic;">Enquiry</span>, section 4,
                11). What are the two kinds, and what features does Hume
                say each has (11)? Give an example of each kind, and
                explain why it is an example. <br>
                <br>
                50. According to Hume, what are "all reasonings about
                matters of fact" based on, besides those we currently
                sense or remember from the past (<span
                  style="font-style: italic;">Enquiry</span>, section 4,
                12)? Give an example to illustrate what he means. How
                does he argue that there is no basis <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">in reason </span>for
                this, but only in experience? What sort of experience,
                specifically (12)? <br>
                <br>
                51. What assumption must we make, according to Hume, to
                get from "B has always followed A in the past" to "B
                will follow A in the future" (<span style="font-style:
                  italic;">Enquiry</span>, section 4, 16)? Why does he
                say this assumption cannot be justified by reason (16)?<br>
                <br>
                52. In Hume's discussion of miracles, what definition of
                "miracle" is he assuming? (This was discussed in class;
                see also <span style="font-style: italic;">Enquiry</span>,
                section 10, pages 58 and 66-7.) Explain how Hume argues
                that "case against a miracle is&#8212;just because it is a
                miracle&#8212;as complete as any argument from experience can
                possibly be imagined to be" (58-9).<br>
                <br>
                53. In part 2 of section 10, Hume gives four (sets of)
                reasons why he thinks testimony of miracles is never
                strong enough to overcome the presumption against them
                (59-62). Pick one of them and explain it.</font><br>

                  A metaphysical game of catch. </span>Descartes throws
                a ball to Spinoza, who catches it and throws it to
                Leibniz, who catches it and then throws it to Berkeley.
                Explain how each of these philosophers would account for
                what's really going on, given his views on what sorts of
                substances there are and how those substances affect
                others (or don't). Be sure to account for (a) each
                thrower's decision to throw the ball, (b) how that
                decision is related to the motion of the ball, and (c)
                each catcher's perception of the ball.<br>

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">C-02. What's God doing
                  here? </span>Most of the philosophers we've studied
                have discussed God in some prominent way. Pick three of
                our philosophers--your choice--and for each one, discuss
                the role(s) God play(s) in his system. <br>

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">C-03. How does he know
                  you're out there? </span>Many of the philosophers
                we've studied have grappled with our knowledge of
                ordinary objects such as tables and chairs. Pick three
                of our philosophers--your choice--and discuss how, and
                how well (e.g., how accurately, with what degree of
                certainty, etc.), each of them believes we know about
                such things. Do not present their <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">arguments</span>; I'm not
                interested in seeing, for example, Descartes's M6
                argument that material things exist. Instead, explain
                how each accounts for our knowing about such things,
                explain how accurate he thinks our knowledge of them is,
                and why. <br>
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">C-04. The argument
                  contest! </span>Think back on all the arguments we've
                looked at in this course. Pick the one you think is the
                very worst, present it (accurately and completely--no <a
                  target="_blank"
                  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man">straw
                  men</a> here!) and make your best case for why it is
                so faulty. Then, pick the one you think is the very
                best, present it, and make your best case for why it is
                so good. (In case you are tempted to pick really short
                arguments: remember that your goal in answering this
                question--as with all other questions--is to show off as
                much as possible how very much you've learned in the
