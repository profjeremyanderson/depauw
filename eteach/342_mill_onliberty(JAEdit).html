                [1] THE subject of this Essay is not the so-called
                Liberty of the Will,
                so unfortunately opposed to the misnamed doctrine of
                Philosophical
                Necessity; but Civil, or Social Liberty: the nature and
                limits of the
                power which can be legitimately exercised by society
                over the
                individual.<br>
                <br>
                ...<br>
                <br>
                [2] The notion, that the people have no need to limit
                their power over
                themselves, might seem axiomatic, when popular
                government was a thing
                only dreamed about, or read of as having existed at some
                distant period
                of the past. Neither was that notion necessarily
                disturbed by such
                temporary aberrations as those of the French Revolution,
                the worst of
                which were the work of an usurping few, and which, in
                any case,
                belonged, not to the permanent working of popular
                institutions, but to
                a sudden and convulsive outbreak against monarchical and
                aristocratic
                despotism. In time, however, a democratic republic came
                to occupy a
                large portion of the earth&#8217;s surface, and made itself
                felt as one of
                the most powerful members of the community of nations;
                and elective and
                responsible government became subject to the
                observations and
                criticisms which wait upon a great existing fact. It was
                now perceived
                that such phrases as &#8220;self-government,&#8221; and &#8220;the power
                of the people
                over themselves,&#8221; do not express the true state of the
                case. The
                &#8220;people&#8221; who exercise the power, are not always the same
                people with
                those over whom it is exercised, and the
                &#8220;self-government&#8221; spoken of,
                is not the government of each by himself, but of each by
                all the rest.
                The will of the people, moreover, practically means, the
                will of the
                most numerous or the most active part of the people; the
                majority, or
                those who succeed in making themselves accepted as the
                majority; the
                people, consequently, may desire to oppress a part of
                their number; and
                precautions are as much needed against this, as against
                any other abuse
                of power. The limitation, therefore, of the power of
                government over
                individuals, loses none of its importance when the
                holders of power are
                regularly accountable to the community, that is, to the
                strongest party
                therein. This view of things, recommending itself
                equally to the
                intelligence of thinkers and to the inclination of those
                important
                classes in European society to whose real or supposed
                interests
                democracy is adverse, has had no difficulty in
                establishing itself; and
                in political speculations &#8220;the tyranny of the majority&#8221;
                is now
                generally included among the evils against which society
                requires to be
                on its guard.<br>
                <br>
                [3] Like other tyrannies, the tyranny of the majority
                was at first, and
                is still vulgarly, held in dread, chiefly as operating
                through the acts
                of the public authorities. But reflecting persons
                perceived that when
                society is itself the tyrant--society collectively, over
                the separate
                individuals who compose it--its means of tyrannizing are
                not restricted
                to the acts which it may do by the hands of its
                political
                functionaries. Society can and does execute its own
                mandates: and if it
                issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates
                at all in
                things with which it ought not to meddle, it practises a
                social tyranny
                more formidable than many kinds of political oppression,
                since, though
                not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves
                fewer means of
                escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of
                life, and
                enslaving the soul itself. Protection, therefore,
                against the tyranny
                of the magistrate is not enough; there needs protection
                also against
                the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling;
                against the tendency
                of society to impose, by other means than civil
                penalties, its own
                ideas and practices as rules of conduct on those who
                dissent from them;
                to fetter the development, and, if possible, prevent the
                formation, of
                any individuality not in harmony with its ways, and
                compel all
                characters to fashion themselves upon the model of its
                own. There is a
                limit to the legitimate interference of collective
                opinion with
                individual independence; and to find that limit, and
                maintain it
                against encroachment, is as indispensable to a good
                condition of human
                affairs, as protection against political despotism.<br>
                <br>
                [4] But though this proposition is not likely to be
                contested in
                general terms, the practical question, where to place
                the limit--how to
                make the fitting adjustment between individual
                independence and social
                control--is a subject on which nearly everything remains
                to be done.
                All that makes existence valuable to any one, depends on
                the
                enforcement of restraints upon the actions of other
                people. Some rules
                of conduct, therefore, must be imposed, by law in the
                first place, and
                by opinion on many things which are not fit subjects for
                the operation
                of law. What these rules should be, is the principal
                question in human
                affairs; but if we except a few of the most obvious
                cases, it is one of
                those which least progress has been made in resolving.<br>
                <br>
                ...<br>
                <br>
                [5] There is, in fact, no recognized principle by which
                the propriety
                or impropriety of government interference is customarily
                tested. People
                decide according to their personal preferences. Some,
                whenever they see
                any good to be done, or evil to be remedied, would
                willingly instigate
                the government to undertake the business; while others
                prefer to bear
                almost any amount of social evil, rather than add one to
                the
                departments of human interests amenable to governmental
                control. And
                men range themselves on one or the other side in any
                particular case,
                according to this general direction of their sentiments;
                or according
                to the degree of interest which they feel in the
                particular thing which
                it is proposed that the government should do; or
                according to the
                belief they entertain that the government would, or
                would not, do it in
                the manner they prefer; but very rarely on account of
                any opinion to
                which they consistently adhere, as to what things are
                fit to be done by
                a government. And it seems to me that, in consequence of
                this absence
                of rule or principle, one side is at present as often
                wrong as the
                other; the interference of government is, with about
                equal frequency,
                improperly invoked and improperly condemned.<br>
                <br>
                <a name="6"></a>[6] The object of this Essay is to
                assert one very
                simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the
                dealings of
                society with the individual in the way of compulsion and
                control,
                whether the means used be physical force in the form of
                legal
                penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. That
                principle is,
                that the sole end for which mankind are warranted,
                individually or
                collectively in interfering with the liberty of action
                of any of their
                number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for
                which power can
                be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized
                community,
                against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own
                good, either
                physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He
                cannot rightfully be
                compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for
                him to do so,
                because it will make him happier, because, in the
                opinions of others,
                to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good
                reasons for
                remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or
                persuading him, or
                entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting
                him with any
                evil, in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the
                conduct from which
                it is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce
                evil to some
                one else. The only part of the conduct of any one, for
                which he is
                amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In
                the part which
                merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right,
                absolute. Over
                himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is
                sovereign.<br>
                <br>
                [7] It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that this
                doctrine is meant
                to apply only to human beings in the maturity of their
                faculties. We
                are not speaking of children, or of young persons below
                the age which
                the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood. Those
                who are still in
                a state to require being taken care of by others, must
                be protected
                against their own actions as well as against external
                injury. For the
                same reason, we may leave out of consideration those
                backward states of
                society in which the race itself may be considered as in
                its nonage.
                The early difficulties in the way of spontaneous
                progress are so great,
                that there is seldom any choice of means for overcoming
                them; and a
                ruler full of the spirit of improvement is warranted in
                the use of any
                expedients that will attain an end, perhaps otherwise
                unattainable.
                Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing
                with
                barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and
                the means
                justified by actually effecting that end. Liberty, as a
                principle, has
                no application to any state of things anterior to the
                time when mankind
                have become capable of being improved by free and equal
                discussion.
                Until then, there is nothing for them but implicit
                obedience to an
                Akbar or a Charlemagne, if they are so fortunate as to
                find one. But as
                soon as mankind have attained the capacity of being
                guided to their own
                improvement by conviction or persuasion (a period long
                since reached in
                all nations with whom we need here concern ourselves),
                compulsion,
                either in the direct form or in that of pains and
                penalties for
                non-compliance, is no longer admissible as a means to
                their own good,
                and justifiable only for the security of others.<br>
                <br>
                [8] It is proper to state that I forego any advantage
                which could be
                derived to my argument from the idea of abstract right
                as a thing
                independent of utility. I regard utility as the ultimate
                appeal on all
                ethical questions; but it must be utility in the largest
                sense,
                grounded on the permanent interests of man as a
                progressive being.
                Those interests, I contend, authorize the subjection of
                individual
                spontaneity to external control, only in respect to
                those actions of
                each, which concern the interest of other people. If any
                one does an
                act hurtful to others, there is a <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">prima
                  facie</span> case for punishing him,
                by law, or, where legal penalties are not safely
                applicable, by general
                disapprobation. There are also many positive acts for
                the benefit of
                others, which he may rightfully be compelled to perform;
                such as, to
                give evidence in a court of justice; to bear his fair
                share in the
                common defence, or in any other joint work necessary to
                the interest of
                the society of which he enjoys the protection; and to
                perform certain
                acts of individual beneficence, such as saving a
                fellow-creature&#8217;s
                life, or interposing to protect the defenceless against
                ill-usage,
                things which whenever it is obviously a man&#8217;s duty to
                do, he may
                rightfully be made responsible to society for not doing.
                A person may
                cause evil to others not only by his actions but by his
                inaction, and
                in either case he is justly accountable to them for the
                injury. The
                latter case, it is true, requires a much more cautious
                exercise of
                compulsion than the former. To make any one answerable
                for doing evil
                to others, is the rule; to make him answerable for not
                preventing evil,
                is, comparatively speaking, the exception. Yet there are
                many cases
                clear enough and grave enough to justify that exception.
                In all things
                which regard the external relations of the individual,
                he is <span style="font-style: italic;">de jure</span>
                amenable to those whose interests are concerned, and if
                need be, to
                society as their protector. There are often good reasons
                for not
                holding him to the responsibility; but these reasons
                must arise from
                the special expediencies of the case: either because it
                is a kind of
                case in which he is on the whole likely to act better,
                when left to his
                own discretion, than when controlled in any way in which
                society have
                it in their power to control him; or because the attempt
                to exercise
                control would produce other evils, greater than those
                which it would
                prevent. When such reasons as these preclude the
                enforcement of
                responsibility, the conscience of the agent himself
                should step into
                the vacant judgment-seat, and protect those interests of
                others which
                have no external protection; judging himself all the
                more rigidly,
                because the case does not admit of his being made
                accountable to the
                judgment of his fellow-creatures.<br>
                <br>
                [9] But there is a sphere of action in which society, as
                distinguished
                from the individual, has, if any, only an indirect
                interest;
                comprehending all that portion of a person&#8217;s life and
                conduct which
                affects only himself, or, if it also affects others,
                only with their
                free, voluntary, and undeceived consent and
                participation. When I say
                only himself, I mean directly, and in the first
                instance: for whatever
                affects himself, may affect others through himself; and
                the objection
                which may be grounded on this contingency, will receive
                consideration
                in the sequel. This, then, is the appropriate region of
                human liberty.
                It comprises, first, the inward domain of consciousness;
                demanding
                liberty of conscience, in the most comprehensive sense;
                liberty of
                thought and feeling; absolute freedom of opinion and
                sentiment on all
                subjects, practical or speculative, scientific, moral,
                or theological.
                The liberty of expressing and publishing opinions may
                seem to fall
                under a different principle, since it belongs to that
                part of the
                conduct of an individual which concerns other people;
                but, being almost
                of as much importance as the liberty of thought itself,
                and resting in
                great part on the same reasons, is practically
                inseparable from it.
                Secondly, the principle requires liberty of tastes and
                pursuits; of
                framing the plan of our life to suit our own character;
                of doing as we
                like, subject to such consequences as may follow;
                without impediment
                from our fellow-creatures, so long as what we do does
                not harm them
                even though they should think our conduct foolish,
                perverse, or wrong.
                Thirdly, from this liberty of each individual, follows
                the liberty,
                within the same limits, of combination among
                individuals; freedom to
                unite, for any purpose not involving harm to others: the
                persons
                combining being supposed to be of full age, and not
                forced or deceived.<br>
                <br>
                [10] No society in which these liberties are not, on the
                whole,
                respected, is free, whatever may be its form of
                government; and none is
                completely free in which they do not exist absolute and
                unqualified.
                The only freedom which deserves the name, is that of
                pursuing our own
                good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to
                deprive others of
                theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it. Each is
                the proper
                guardian of his own health, whether bodily, or mental or
                spiritual.
                Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to
                live as seems
                good to themselves, than by compelling each to live as
                seems good to
                the rest.<br>
                <br>
                [11] Though this doctrine is anything but new, and, to
                some persons,
                may have the air of a truism, there is no doctrine which
                stands more
                directly opposed to the general tendency of existing
                opinion and
                practice. Society has expended fully as much effort in
                the attempt
                (according to its lights) to compel people to conform to
                its notions of
                personal, as of social excellence. The ancient
                commonwealths thought
                themselves entitled to practise, and the ancient
                philosophers
                countenanced, the regulation of every part of private
                conduct by public
                authority, on the ground that the State had a deep
                interest in the
                whole bodily and mental discipline of every one of its
                citizens, a mode
                of thinking which may have been admissible in small
                republics
                surrounded by powerful enemies, in constant peril of
                being subverted by
                foreign attack or internal commotion, and to which even
                a short
                interval of relaxed energy and self-command might so
                easily be fatal,
                that they could not afford to wait for the salutary
                permanent effects
                of freedom. In the modern world, the greater size of
                political
                communities, and above all, the separation between the
                spiritual and
                temporal authority (which placed the direction of men&#8217;s
                consciences in
                other hands than those which controlled their worldly
                affairs),
                prevented so great an interference by law in the details
                of private
                life; but the engines of moral repression have been
                wielded more
                strenuously against divergence from the reigning opinion
                in
                self-regarding, than even in social matters; religion,
                the most
                powerful of the elements which have entered into the
                formation of moral
                feeling, having almost always been governed either by
                the ambition of a
                hierarchy, seeking control over every department of
                human conduct, or
                by the spirit of Puritanism. And some of those modern
                reformers who
                have placed themselves in strongest opposition to the
                religions of the
                past, have been nowhere behind either churches or sects
                in their
                assertion of the right of spiritual domination: M.
                Compte, in
                particular, whose social system, as unfolded in his
                Trait de Politique
                Positive, aims at establishing (though by moral more
                than by legal
                appliances) a despotism of society over the individual,
                surpassing
                anything contemplated in the political ideal of the most
                rigid
                disciplinarian among the ancient philosophers.<br>
                <br>
                [12] Apart from the peculiar tenets of individual
                thinkers, there is
                also in the world at large an increasing inclination to
                stretch unduly
                the powers of society over the individual, both by the
                force of opinion
                and even by that of legislation: and as the tendency of
                all the changes
                taking place in the world is to strengthen society, and
                diminish the
                power of the individual, this encroachment is not one of
                the evils
                which tend spontaneously to disappear, but, on the
                contrary, to grow
                more and more formidable. The disposition of mankind,
                whether as rulers
                or as fellow-citizens, to impose their own opinions and
                inclinations as
                a rule of conduct on others, is so energetically
                supported by some of
                the best and by some of the worst feelings incident to
                human nature,
                that it is hardly ever kept under restraint by anything
                but want of
                power; and as the power is not declining, but growing,
                unless a strong
                barrier of moral conviction can be raised against the
                mischief, we must
                expect, in the present circumstances of the world, to
                see it increase.<br>
                <br>
                [13] It will be convenient for the argument, if, instead
                of at once
                entering upon the general thesis, we confine ourselves
                in the first
                instance to a single branch of it, on which the
                principle here stated
                is, if not fully, yet to a certain point, recognized by
                the current
                opinions. This one branch is the Liberty of Thought:
                from which it is
                impossible to separate the cognate liberty of speaking
                and of writing.
                Although these liberties, to some considerable amount,
                form part of the
                political morality of all countries which profess
                religious toleration
                and free institutions, the grounds, both philosophical
                and practical,
                on which they rest, are perhaps not so familiar to the
                general mind,
                nor so thoroughly appreciated by many even of the
                leaders of opinion,
                as might have been expected. Those grounds, when rightly
                understood,
                are of much wider application than to only one division
                of the subject,
                and a thorough consideration of this part of the
                question will be found
                the best introduction to the remainder. Those to whom
                nothing which I
                am about to say will be new, may therefore, I hope,
                excuse me, if on a
                subject which for now three centuries has been so often
                discussed, I
                venture on one discussion more.<br>

                  to be hoped,
                  is gone by when any defence would be
                  necessary of the &#8220;liberty of the press&#8221; as one of the
                  securities
                  against corrupt or tyrannical government....
                  [S]peaking generally, it
                  is not, in constitutional countries, to be apprehended
                  that the
                  government, whether completely responsible to the
                  people or not, will
                  often attempt to control the expression of opinion,
                  except when in
                  doing so it makes itself the organ of the general
                  intolerance of the
                  public. Let us suppose, therefore, that the government
                  is entirely at
                  one with the people, and never thinks of exerting any
                  power of coercion
                  unless in agreement with what it conceives to be their
                  voice. But I
                  deny the right of the people to exercise such
                  coercion, either by
                  themselves or by their government. The power itself is
                  illegitimate.
                  The best government has no more title to it than the
                  worst. It is as
                  noxious, or more noxious, when exerted in accordance
                  with public
                  opinion, than when in opposition to it. If all mankind
                  minus one, were
                  of one opinion, and only one person were of the
                  contrary opinion,
                  mankind would be no more justified in silencing that
                  one person, than
                  he, if he had the power, would be justified in
                  silencing mankind. Were
                  an opinion a personal possession of no value except to
                  the owner; if to
                  be obstructed in the enjoyment of it were simply a
                  private injury, it
                  would make some difference whether the injury was
                  inflicted only on a
                  few persons or on many. But the peculiar evil of
                  silencing the
                  expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the
                  human race;
                  posterity as well as the existing generation; those
                  who dissent from
                  the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the
                  opinion is
                  right, they are deprived of the opportunity of
                  exchanging error for
                  truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a
                  benefit, the
                  clearer perception and livelier impression of truth,
                  produced by its
                  collision with error.</span><br style="font-family:

                  style="font-family: Georgia;">[15] It is necessary to
                  consider
                  separately these two
                  hypotheses, each of which has a distinct branch of the
                  argument
                  corresponding to it. We can never be sure that the
                  opinion we are
                  endeavouring to stifle is a false opinion; and if we
                  were sure,
                  stifling it would be an evil still.</span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[16] First: the
                  opinion which it is
                  attempted to suppress by authority
                  may possibly be true. Those who desire to suppress it,
                  of course deny
                  its truth; but they are not infallible. They have no
                  authority to
                  decide the question for all mankind, and exclude every
                  other person
                  from the means of judging. To refuse a hearing to an
                  opinion, because
                  they are sure that it is false, is to assume that
                  their certainty is
                  the same thing as absolute certainty. All silencing of
                  discussion is an
                  assumption of infallibility. Its condemnation may be
                  allowed to rest on
                  this common argument, not the worse for being common.</span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">

                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[17] The objection
                  likely to be
                  made to this argument, would probably
                  take some such form as the following. There is no
                  greater assumption of
                  infallibility in forbidding the propagation of error,
                  than in any other
                  thing which is done by public authority on its own
                  judgment and
                  responsibility. Judgment is given to men that they may
                  use it. Because
                  it may be used erroneously, are men to be told that
                  they ought not to
                  use it at all? To prohibit what they think pernicious,
                  is not claiming
                  exemption from error, but fulfilling the duty
                  incumbent on them,
                  although fallible, of acting on their conscientious
                  conviction. If we
                  were never to act on our opinions, because those
                  opinions may be wrong,
                  we should leave all our interests uncared for, and all
                  our duties
                  unperformed. An objection which applies to all conduct
                  can be no valid
                  objection to any conduct in particular.</span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[18] It is the duty
                  of governments,
                  and of individuals, to form the
                  truest opinions they can; to form them carefully, and
                  never impose them
                  upon others unless they are quite sure of being right.
                  But when they
                  are sure (such reasoners may say), it is not
                  conscientiousness but
                  cowardice to shrink from acting on their opinions, and
                  allow doctrines
                  which they honestly think dangerous to the welfare of
                  mankind, either
                  in this life or in another, to be scattered abroad
                  without restraint,
                  because other people, in less enlightened times, have
                  persecuted
                  opinions now believed to be true. Let us take care, it
                  may be said, not
                  to make the same mistake: but governments and nations
                  have made
                  mistakes in other things, which are not denied to be
                  fit subjects for
                  the exercise of authority: they have laid on bad
                  taxes, made unjust
                  wars. Ought we therefore to lay on no taxes, and,
                  under whatever
                  provocation, make no wars? Men, and governments, must
                  act to the best
                  of their ability. There is no such thing as absolute
                  certainty, but
                  there is assurance sufficient for the purposes of
                  human life. We may,
                  and must, assume our opinion to be true for the
                  guidance of our own
                  conduct: and it is assuming no more when we forbid bad
                  men to pervert
                  society by the propagation of opinions which we regard
                  as false and
                  pernicious.</span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[19] I answer, that
                  it is assuming
                  very much more. There is the
                  greatest difference between presuming an opinion to be
                  true, because,
                  with every opportunity for contesting it, it has not
                  been refuted, and
                  assuming its truth for the purpose of not permitting
                  its refutation.
                  Complete liberty of contradicting and disproving our
                  opinion, is the
                  very condition which justifies us in assuming its
                  truth for purposes of
                  action; and on no other terms can a being with human
                  faculties have any
                  rational assurance of being right.</span><br

                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[20] When we
                  consider either the
                  history of opinion, or the ordinary
                  conduct of human life, to what is it to be ascribed
                  that the one and
                  the other are no worse than they are? ...Why is
                  it...that there is on
                  the whole a preponderance among mankind of rational
                  opinions and
                  rational conduct? If there really is this
                  preponderance--which there
                  must be, unless human affairs are, and have always
                  been, in an almost
                  desperate state--it is owing to a quality of the human
                  mind, the source
                  of everything respectable in man, either as an
                  intellectual or as a
                  moral being, namely, that his errors are corrigible.
                  He is capable of
                  rectifying his mistakes by discussion and experience.
                  Not by experience
                  alone. There must be discussion, to show how
                  experience is to be
                  interpreted. Wrong opinions and practices gradually
                  yield to fact and
                  argument: but facts and arguments, to produce any
                  effect on the mind,
                  must be brought before it. Very few facts are able to
                  tell their own
                  story, without comments to bring out their meaning.
                  The whole strength

                  one property, that
                  it can be set right when it is wrong, reliance can be

                  those who are best entitled to trust their own
                  judgment, find necessary
                  to warrant their relying on it, should be submitted to
                  by that
                  miscellaneous collection of a few wise and many
                  foolish individuals,
                  called the public. The most intolerant of churches,
                  the Roman Catholic
                  Church, even at the canonization of a saint, admits,
                  and listens
                  patiently to, a &#8220;devil&#8217;s advocate.&#8221; The holiest of
                  men, it appears,
                  cannot be admitted to posthumous honors, until all
                  that the devil could
                  say against him is known and weighed. </span><br

                  been described as &#8220;destitute of
                  faith, but terrified at scepticism,&#8221;--in which people
                  feel sure, not so
                  much that their opinions are true, as that they should
                  not know what to
                  do without them--the claims of an opinion to be
                  protected from public
                  attack are rested not so much on its truth, as on its
                  importance to
                  society. There are, it is alleged, certain beliefs, so
                  useful, not to
                  say indispensable to well-being, that it is as much
                  the duty of
                  governments to uphold those beliefs, as to protect any
                  other of the
                  interests of society. In a case of such necessity, and
                  so directly in
                  the line of their duty, something less than
                  infallibility may, it is
                  maintained, warrant, and even bind, governments, to
                  act on their own
                  opinion, confirmed by the general opinion of
                  mankind.... But those who
                  thus satisfy themselves, do not perceive that the
                  assumption of
                  infallibility is merely shifted from one point to
                  another. The
                  usefulness of an opinion is itself matter of opinion:
                  as disputable, as
                  open to discussion and requiring discussion as much,
                  as the opinion
                  itself....</span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">

                  positive any one&#8217;s
                  persuasion may be, not only of the
                  falsity, but of the pernicious consequences--not only
                  of the pernicious
                  consequences, but (to adopt expressions which I
                  altogether condemn) the
                  immorality and impiety of an opinion; yet if, in
                  pursuance of that
                  private judgment, though backed by the public judgment
                  of his country
                  or his contemporaries, he prevents the opinion from
                  being heard in its
                  defence, he assumes infallibility. And so far from the
                  assumption being
                  less objectionable or less dangerous because the
                  opinion is called
                  immoral or impious, this is the case of all others in
                  which it is most
                  fatal. These are exactly the occasions on which the
                  men of one

                  hardly be too
                  often reminded, that there was once a
                  man named Socrates, between whom and the legal
                  authorities and public
                  opinion of his time, there took place a memorable
                  collision.... This
                  acknowledged master of all the eminent thinkers who
                  have since
                  lived--whose fame, still growing after more than two
                  thousand years,
                  all but outweighs the whole remainder of the names
                  which make his
                  native city illustrious--was put to death by his
                  countrymen, after a
                  judicial conviction, for impiety and immorality.
                  Impiety, in denying
                  the gods recognized by the State; indeed his accuser
                  asserted (see the
                  &#8220;Apologia&#8221;) that he believed in no gods at all.
                  Immorality, in being,
                  by his doctrines and instructions, a &#8220;corrupter of
                  youth.&#8221; Of these
                  charges the tribunal, there is every ground for
                  believing, honestly
                  found him guilty, and condemned the man who probably
                  of all then born
                  had deserved best of mankind, to be put to death as a
                  criminal.</span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[25] To pass from
                  this to the only
                  other instance of judicial iniquity,
                  the mention of which, after the condemnation of
                  Socrates, would not be
                  an anti-climax: the event which took place on Calvary
                  rather more than
                  eighteen hundred years ago. The man who left on the
                  memory of those who
                  witnessed his life and conversation, such an
                  impression of his moral
                  grandeur, that eighteen subsequent centuries have done
                  homage to him as
                  the Almighty in person, was ignominiously put to
                  death, as what? As a
                  blasphemer. Men did not merely mistake their
                  benefactor; they mistook
                  him for the exact contrary of what he was, and treated
                  him as that
                  prodigy of impiety, which they themselves are now held
                  to be, for their
                  treatment of him. The feelings with which mankind now
                  regard these
                  lamentable transactions, especially the latter of the
                  two, render them
                  extremely unjust in their judgment of the unhappy
                  actors. These were,
                  to all appearance, not bad men--not worse than men
                  most commonly are,
                  but rather the contrary; men who possessed in a full,
                  or somewhat more
                  than a full measure, the religious, moral, and
                  patriotic feelings of
                  their time and people: the very kind of men who, in
                  all times, our own
                  included, have every chance of passing through life
                  blameless and
                  respected. The high-priest who rent his garments when
                  the words were
                  pronounced, which, according to all the ideas of his
                  country,
                  constituted the blackest guilt, was in all probability
                  quite as sincere
                  in his horror and indignation, as the generality of
                  respectable and
                  pious men now are in the religious and moral
                  sentiments they profess;
                  and most of those who now shudder at his conduct, if
                  they had lived in
                  his time and been born Jews, would have acted
                  precisely as he did.
                  Orthodox Christians who are tempted to think that
                  those who stoned to
                  death the first martyrs must have been worse men than
                  they themselves
                  are, ought to remember that one of those persecutors

                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[26] Let us add one
                  more example,
                  the most striking of all, if the
                  impressiveness of an error is measured by the wisdom
                  and virtue of him
                  who falls into it. If ever any one, possessed of
                  power, had grounds for
                  thinking himself the best and most enlightened among
                  his
                  contemporaries, it was the Emperor Marcus Aurelius.
                  Absolute monarch of
                  the whole civilized world, he preserved through life
                  not only the most
                  unblemished justice, but what was less to be expected
                  from his Stoical
                  breeding, the tenderest heart. The few failings which
                  are attributed to
                  him, were all on the side of indulgence: while his
                  writings, the
                  highest ethical product of the ancient mind, differ
                  scarcely
                  perceptibly, if they differ at all, from the most
                  characteristic
                  teachings of Christ. This man, a better Christian in
                  all but the
                  dogmatic sense of the word, than almost any of the
                  ostensibly Christian
                  sovereigns who have since reigned, persecuted
                  Christianity. Placed at
                  the summit of all the previous attainments of
                  humanity, with an open,
                  unfettered intellect, and a character which led him of
                  himself to
                  embody in his moral writings the Christian ideal, he
                  yet failed to see
                  that Christianity was to be a good and not an evil to
                  the world, with
                  his duties to which he was so deeply penetrated.
                  Existing society he
                  knew to be in a deplorable state. But such as it was,
                  he saw or thought
                  he saw, that it was held together and prevented from
                  being worse, by
                  belief and reverence of the received divinities. As a
                  ruler of mankind,
                  he deemed it his duty not to suffer society to fall in
                  pieces; and saw
                  not how, if its existing ties were removed, any others
                  could be formed
                  which could again knit it together. The new religion
                  openly aimed at
                  dissolving these ties: unless, therefore, it was his
                  duty to adopt that
                  religion, it seemed to be his duty to put it down.
                  Inasmuch then as the
                  theology of Christianity did not appear to him true or
                  of divine
                  origin; inasmuch as this strange history of a
                  crucified God was not
                  credible to him, and a system which purported to rest
                  entirely upon a
                  foundation to him so wholly unbelievable, could not be
                  foreseen by him
                  to be that renovating agency which, after all
                  abatements, it has in
                  fact proved to be; the gentlest and most amiable of
                  philosophers and
                  rulers, under a solemn sense of duty, authorized the
                  persecution of
                  Christianity. To my mind this is one of the most
                  tragical facts in all
                  history. It is a bitter thought, how different a thing
                  the Christianity
                  of the world might have been, if the Christian faith
                  had been adopted
                  as the religion of the empire under the auspices of
                  Marcus Aurelius
                  instead of those of Constantine. But it would be
                  equally unjust to him
                  and false to truth, to deny, that no one plea which
                  can be urged for
                  punishing anti-Christian teaching, was wanting to
                  Marcus Aurelius for
                  punishing, as he did, the propagation of Christianity.
                  No Christian
                  more firmly believes that Atheism is false, and tends
                  to the
                  dissolution of society, than Marcus Aurelius believed
                  the same things
                  of Christianity; he who, of all men then living, might
                  have been
                  thought the most capable of appreciating it. Unless
                  any one who
                  approves of punishment for the promulgation of
                  opinions, flatters
                  himself that he is a wiser and better man than Marcus
                  Aurelius--more
                  deeply versed in the wisdom of his time, more elevated
                  in his intellect
                  above it--more earnest in his search for truth, or
                  more single-minded
                  in his devotion to it when found;--let him abstain
                  from that assumption
                  of the joint infallibility of himself and the
                  multitude, which the
                  great Antoninus made with so unfortunate a result.</span><br

                  to the second
                  division of the argument, and
                  dismissing the Supposition that any of the received
                  opinions may be
                  false, let us assume them to be true, and examine into
                  the worth of the
                  manner in which they are likely to be held, when their
                  truth is not
                  freely and openly canvassed. However unwillingly a
                  person who has a
                  strong opinion may admit the possibility that his
                  opinion may be false,
                  he ought to be moved by the consideration that however
                  true it may be,
                  if it is not fully, frequently, and fearlessly
                  discussed, it will be
                  held as a dead dogma, not a living truth.</span><br

                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[29] There is a
                  class of persons
                  (happily not quite so numerous as
                  formerly) who think it enough if a person assents
                  undoubtingly to what
                  they think true, though he has no knowledge whatever
                  of the grounds of
                  the opinion, and could not make a tenable defence of
                  it against the
                  most superficial objections.... [A]ssuming that the
                  true opinion abides
                  in the mind, but abides as a prejudice, a belief
                  independent of, and
                  proof against, argument--this is not the way in which
                  truth ought to be
                  held by a rational being. This is not knowing the
                  truth. Truth, thus
                  held, is but one superstition the more, accidentally
                  clinging to the
                  words which enunciate a truth.</span><br

                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[30] If the
                  intellect and judgment
                  of mankind ought to be cultivated, a
                  thing which Protestants at least do not deny, on what
                  can these
                  faculties be more appropriately exercised by any one,
                  than on the
                  things which concern him so much that it is considered
                  necessary for
                  him to hold opinions on them? If the cultivation of
                  the understanding
                  consists in one thing more than in another, it is
                  surely in learning
                  the grounds of one&#8217;s own opinions. Whatever people
                  believe, on subjects
                  on which it is of the first importance to believe
                  rightly, they ought
                  to be able to defend against at least the common
                  objections. But, some
                  one may say, &#8220;Let them be taught the grounds of their
                  opinions. It does
                  not follow that opinions must be merely parroted
                  because they are never
                  heard controverted. Persons who learn geometry do not
                  simply commit the
                  theorems to memory, but understand and learn likewise
                  the
                  demonstrations; and it would be absurd to say that
                  they remain ignorant
                  of the grounds of geometrical truths, because they
                  never hear any one
                  deny, and attempt to disprove them.&#8221; Undoubtedly: and
                  such teaching
                  suffices on a subject like mathematics, where there is
                  nothing at all
                  to be said on the wrong side of the question. The
                  peculiarity of the
                  evidence of mathematical truths is, that all the
                  argument is on one
                  side. There are no objections, and no answers to
                  objections. But on
                  every subject on which difference of opinion is
                  possible, the truth
                  depends on a balance to be struck between two sets of
                  conflicting
                  reasons. Even in natural philosophy, there is always
                  some other
                  explanation possible of the same facts; some
                  geocentric theory instead
                  of heliocentric, some phlogiston instead of oxygen;
                  and it has to be
                  shown why that other theory cannot be the true one:
                  and until this is
                  shown and until we know how it is shown, we do not
                  understand the
                  grounds of our opinion. But when we turn to subjects
                  infinitely more
                  complicated, to morals, religion, politics, social
                  relations, and the
                  business of life, three-fourths of the arguments for
                  every disputed
                  opinion consist in dispelling the appearances which
                  favor some opinion
                  different from it. The greatest orator, save one, of
                  antiquity, has
                  left it on record that he always studied his
                  adversary&#8217;s case with as
                  great, if not with still greater, intensity than even
                  his own. What
                  Cicero practised as the means of forensic success,
                  requires to be
                  imitated by all who study any subject in order to
                  arrive at the truth.
                  He who knows only his own side of the case, knows
                  little of that. His
                  reasons may be good, and no one may have been able to
                  refute them. But
                  if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the
                  opposite side; if
                  he does not so much as know what they are, he has no
                  ground for
                  preferring either opinion....</span><br

                  tendency of mankind
                  to leave off thinking about a thing
                  when it is no longer doubtful, is the cause of half
                  their errors. A
                  contemporary author has well spoken of &#8220;the deep
                  slumber of a decided
                  opinion.&#8221;</span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">

                  may be asked) Is
                  the absence of unanimity an
                  indispensable condition of true knowledge? Is it
                  necessary that some
                  part of mankind should persist in error, to enable any
                  to realize the
                  truth? Does a belief cease to be real and vital as
                  soon as it is
                  generally received--and is a proposition never
                  thoroughly understood
                  and felt unless some doubt of it remains? As soon as
                  mankind have
                  unanimously accepted a truth, does the truth perish
                  within them? The
                  highest aim and best result of improved intelligence,
                  it has hitherto
                  been thought, is to unite mankind more and more in the
                  acknowledgment
                  of all important truths: and does the intelligence
                  only last as long as
                  it has not achieved its object? Do the fruits of
                  conquest perish by the
                  very completeness of the victory?</span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[33] I affirm no
                  such thing. As
                  mankind improve, the number of
                  doctrines which are no longer disputed or doubted will
                  be constantly on
                  the increase: and the well-being of mankind may almost
                  be measured by
                  the number and gravity of the truths which have
                  reached the point of
                  being uncontested. The cessation, on one question
                  after another, of
                  serious controversy, is one of the necessary incidents
                  of the
                  consolidation of opinion; a consolidation as salutary
                  in the case of
                  true opinions, as it is dangerous and noxious when the
                  opinions are
                  erroneous. But though this gradual narrowing of the
                  bounds of diversity
                  of opinion is necessary in both senses of the term,
                  being at once
                  inevitable and indispensable, we are not therefore
                  obliged to conclude
                  that all its consequences must be beneficial. The loss
                  of so important
                  an aid to the intelligent and living apprehension of a
                  truth, as is
                  afforded by the necessity of explaining it to, or
                  defending it against,
                  opponents, though not sufficient to outweigh, is no
                  trifling drawback
                  from, the benefit of its universal recognition. Where
                  this advantage
                  can no longer be had, I confess I should like to see
                  the teachers of
                  mankind endeavoring to provide a substitute for it;
                  some contrivance
                  for making the difficulties of the question as present
                  to the learner&#8217;s
                  consciousness, as if they were pressed upon him by a
                  dissentient
                  champion, eager for his conversion.</span><br

                  remains to speak of
                  one of the principal causes which
                  make diversity of opinion advantageous, and will
                  continue to do so
                  until mankind shall have entered a stage of
                  intellectual advancement
                  which at present seems at an incalculable distance. We
                  have hitherto
                  considered only two possibilities: that the received
                  opinion may be
                  false, and some other opinion, consequently, true; or
                  that, the
                  received opinion being true, a conflict with the
                  opposite error is
                  essential to a clear apprehension and deep feeling of
                  its truth. But
                  there is a commoner case than either of these; when
                  the conflicting
                  doctrines, instead of being one true and the other
                  false, share the
                  truth between them; and the nonconforming opinion is
                  needed to supply
                  the remainder of the truth, of which the received
                  doctrine embodies
                  only a part. Popular opinions, on subjects not
                  palpable to sense, are
                  often true, but seldom or never the whole truth. They
                  are a part of the
                  truth; sometimes a greater, sometimes a smaller part,
                  but exaggerated,
                  distorted, and disjoined from the truths by which they
                  ought to be
                  accompanied and limited. Heretical opinions, on the
                  other hand, are
                  generally some of these suppressed and neglected
                  truths, bursting the
                  bonds which kept them down, and either seeking
                  reconciliation with the
                  truth contained in the common opinion, or fronting it
                  as enemies, and
                  setting themselves up, with similar exclusiveness, as
                  the whole truth.
                  The latter case is hitherto the most frequent, as, in
                  the human mind,
                  one-sidedness has always been the rule, and
                  many-sidedness the
                  exception. Hence, even in revolutions of opinion, one
                  part of the truth
                  usually sets while another rises. Even progress, which
                  ought to
                  superadd, for the most part only substitutes one
                  partial and incomplete
                  truth for another; improvement consisting chiefly in
                  this, that the new
                  fragment of truth is more wanted, more adapted to the
                  needs of the
                  time, than that which it displaces. Such being the
                  partial character of
                  prevailing opinions, even when resting on a true
                  foundation; every
                  opinion which embodies somewhat of the portion of
                  truth which the
                  common opinion omits, ought to be considered precious,
                  with whatever
                  amount of error and confusion that truth may be
                  blended. No sober judge
                  of human affairs will feel bound to be indignant
                  because those who
                  force on our notice truths which we should otherwise
                  have overlooked,
                  overlook some of those which we see. Rather, he will
                  think that so long
                  as popular truth is one-sided, it is more desirable
                  than otherwise that
                  unpopular truth should have one-sided asserters too;
                  such being usually
                  the most energetic, and the most likely to compel
                  reluctant attention
                  to the fragment of wisdom which they proclaim as if it
                  were the whole.</span><br style="font-family:

                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[35] I do not
                  pretend that the most
                  unlimited use of the freedom of
                  enunciating all possible opinions would put an end to
                  the evils of
                  religious or philosophical sectarianism. Every truth
                  which men of
                  narrow capacity are in earnest about, is sure to be
                  asserted,
                  inculcated, and in many ways even acted on, as if no
                  other truth
                  existed in the world, or at all events none that could
                  limit or qualify
                  the first. I acknowledge that the tendency of all
                  opinions to become
                  sectarian is not cured by the freest discussion, but
                  is often
                  heightened and exacerbated thereby; the truth which
                  ought to have been,
                  but was not, seen, being rejected all the more
                  violently because
                  proclaimed by persons regarded as opponents. But it is
                  not on the
                  impassioned partisan, it is on the calmer and more
                  disinterested
                  bystander, that this collision of opinions works its
                  salutary effect.
                  Not the violent conflict between parts of the truth,
                  but the quiet
                  suppression of half of it, is the formidable evil:
                  there is always hope
                  when people are forced to listen to both sides; it is
                  when they attend
                  only to one that errors harden into prejudices, and
                  truth itself ceases
                  to have the effect of truth, by being exaggerated into
                  falsehood. And
                  since there are few mental attributes more rare than
                  that judicial
                  faculty which can sit in intelligent judgment between
                  two sides of a
                  question, of which only one is represented by an
                  advocate before it,
                  truth has no chance but in proportion as every side of
                  it, every
                  opinion which embodies any fraction of the truth, not
                  only finds
                  advocates, but is so advocated as to be listened to.</span><br

                  style="font-family: Georgia;">[36] We have now
                  recognized the
                  necessity to the
                  mental well-being of mankind (on which all their other
                  well-being
                  depends) of freedom of opinion, and freedom of the
                  expression of
                  opinion, on four distinct grounds; which we will now
                  briefly
                  recapitulate.</span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[37] First, if any
                  opinion is
                  compelled to silence, that opinion may,
                  for aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this
                  is to assume our
                  own infallibility.</span><br style="font-family:

                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[38] Secondly,
                  though the silenced
                  opinion be an error, it may, and
                  very commonly does, contain a portion of truth; and
                  since the general
                  or prevailing opinion on any object is rarely or never
                  the whole truth,
                  it is only by the collision of adverse opinions that
                  the remainder of
                  the truth has any chance of being supplied.</span><br
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <br style="font-family: Georgia;">
                <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[39] Thirdly, even
                  if the received
                  opinion be not only true, but the
                  whole truth; unless it is suffered to be, and actually
                  is, vigorously
                  and earnestly contested, it will, by most of those who
                  receive it, be
                  held in the manner of a prejudice, with little
                  comprehension or feeling
                  of its rational grounds. And not only this, but,
                  fourthly, the meaning
                  of the doctrine itself will be in danger of being
                  lost, or enfeebled,
                  and deprived of its vital effect on the character and
                  conduct: the
                  dogma becoming a mere formal profession, inefficacious
                  for good, but
                  cumbering the ground, and preventing the growth of any
                  real and
                  heartfelt conviction, from reason or personal
                  experience.</span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">

                <a style="font-family: Georgia;" name="40"></a><span
                  style="font-family: Georgia;">[40] Before quitting the
                  subject of
                  freedom of
                  opinion, it is fit to take notice of those who say,
                  that the free
                  expression of all opinions should be permitted, on
                  condition that the
                  manner be temperate, and do not pass the bounds of
                  fair discussion.
                  Much might be said on the impossibility of fixing
                  where these supposed
                  bounds are to be placed; for if the test be offence to
                  those whose
                  opinion is attacked, I think experience testifies that
                  this offence is
                  given whenever the attack is telling and powerful, and
                  that every
                  opponent who pushes them hard, and whom they find it
                  difficult to
                  answer, appears to them, if he shows any strong
                  feeling on the subject,
                  an intemperate opponent. But this, though an important
                  consideration in
                  a practical point of view, merges in a more
                  fundamental objection.
                  Undoubtedly the manner of asserting an opinion, even
                  though it be a
                  true one, may be very objectionable, and may justly
                  incur severe
                  censure. But the principal offences of the kind are
                  such as it is
                  mostly impossible, unless by accidental self-betrayal,
                  to bring home to
                  conviction. The gravest of them is, to argue
                  sophistically, to suppress
                  facts or arguments, to misstate the elements of the
                  case, or
                  misrepresent the opposite opinion. But all this, even
                  to the most
                  aggravated degree, is so continually done in perfect
                  good faith, by
                  persons who are not considered, and in many other
                  respects may not
                  deserve to be considered, ignorant or incompetent,
                  that it is rarely
                  possible on adequate grounds conscientiously to stamp
                  the
                  misrepresentation as morally culpable; and still less
                  could law presume
                  to interfere with this kind of controversial
                  misconduct. With regard to
                  what is commonly meant by intemperate discussion,
                  namely, invective,
                  sarcasm, personality [i.e., personal attacks], and the
                  like, the
                  denunciation of these weapons would deserve more
                  sympathy if it were
                  ever proposed to interdict them equally to both sides;
                  but it is only
                  desired to restrain the employment of them against the
                  prevailing
                  opinion: against the unprevailing they may not only be
                  used without
                  general disapproval, but will be likely to obtain for
                  him who uses them
                  the praise of honest zeal and righteous indignation.
                  Yet whatever
                  mischief arises from their use, is greatest when they
                  are employed
                  against the comparatively defenceless; and whatever
                  unfair advantage
                  can be derived by any opinion from this mode of
                  asserting it, accrues
                  almost exclusively to received opinions. The worst
                  offence of this kind
                  which can be committed by a polemic, is to stigmatize
                  those who hold
                  the contrary opinion as bad and immoral men. To
                  calumny of this sort,
                  those who hold any unpopular opinion are peculiarly
                  exposed, because
                  they are in general few and uninfluential, and nobody
                  but themselves
                  feels much interest in seeing justice done them; but
                  this weapon is,
                  from the nature of the case, denied to those who
                  attack a prevailing
                  opinion: they can neither use it with safety to
                  themselves, nor if they
                  could, would it do anything but recoil on their own
                  cause. In general,
                  opinions contrary to those commonly received can only
                  obtain a hearing
                  by studied moderation of language, and the most
                  cautious avoidance of
                  unnecessary offence, from which they hardly ever
                  deviate even in a
                  slight degree without losing ground: while unmeasured
                  vituperation
                  employed on the side of the prevailing opinion, really
                  does deter
                  people from professing contrary opinions, and from
                  listening to those
                  who profess them. For the interest, therefore, of
                  truth and justice, it
                  is far more important to restrain this employment of
                  vituperative
                  language than the other; and, for example, if it were
                  necessary to
                  choose, there would be much more need to discourage
                  offensive attacks
                  on infidelity, than on religion. It is, however,
                  obvious that law and
                  authority have no business with restraining either,
                  while opinion
                  ought, in every instance, to determine its verdict by
                  the circumstances
                  of the individual case; condemning every one, on
                  whichever side of the
                  argument he places himself, in whose mode of advocacy
                  either want of
                  candor, or malignity, bigotry or intolerance of
                  feeling manifest
                  themselves, but not inferring these vices from the
                  side which a person
                  takes, though it be the contrary side of the question
                  to our own; and
                  giving merited honor to every one, whatever opinion he
                  may hold, who
                  has calmness to see and honesty to state what his
                  opponents and their
                  opinions really are, exaggerating nothing to their
                  discredit, keeping
                  nothing back which tells, or can be supposed to tell,
                  in their favor.
                  This is the real morality of public discussion; and if
                  often violated,
                  I am happy to think that there are many
                  controversialists who to a
                  great extent observe it, and a still greater number
                  who conscientiously
                  strive towards it. </span></font>
