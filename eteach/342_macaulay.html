        class of offences against the body consists of those offences
        which affect human life; and highest in this first class stand
        those offences which fall under the definition of voluntary
        culpable homicide. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">

        style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[2] This important part of the
        law appears to us to require fuller explanation than almost any
        other. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">

        style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[3] The first point to which
        we wish to call the attention of his Lordship in Council is the
        expression "omits what he is legally bound to do," in the
        definition of voluntary culpable homicide. These words or other
        words tantamount in effect frequently recur in the Code. We
        think this the most convenient place for explaining the reason
        which has led us so often to employ them. For if that reason
        shall appear to be sufficient in cases in which human life is
        concerned, it will </span><a style=" font-family: Georgia;"
        target="_blank"
        href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/a%20fortiori"><span
          style="font-style: italic;">a fortiori</span></a><span
        style="font-family: Georgia;"> be sufficient in other cases. </span><br
        style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <o:p style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</o:p><br
        style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[4] Early in the progress of
        the Code it became necessary for us to consider the following
        question: When acts are made punishable on the ground that those
        acts produce, or are intended to produce, or are known to be
        likely to produce certain evil effects, to what extent ought
        omissions which produce, which are intended to produce, or which
        are known to be likely to produce the same evil effects to be
        made punishable? </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <o:p style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</o:p><br
        style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[5] Two things we take to be
        evident: first, that some of these omissions ought to be
        punished in exactly the same manner in which acts are punished;
        secondly that all these omissions ought not to be punished. It
        will hardly be disputed that a jailer who voluntarily causes the
        death of a prisoner by omitting to supply that prisoner with
        food, or a nurse who voluntarily causes the death of an infant
        intrusted to her care by omitting to take it out of a tub of
        water into which it has fallen, ought to be treated as guilty of
        murder. On the other hand, it will hardly be maintained that a
        man should be punished as a murderer because he omitted to
        relieve a beggar, even though there might be the clearest proof
        that the death of the beggar was the result of the omission, and
        that the man who omitted to give the alms knew that the death of
        the beggar was likely to be the effect of the omission. It will
        hardly be maintained that a surgeon ought to be treated as a
        murderer for refusing to go from Calcutta to Meerut [a distance
        of around 850 miles--JA] to perform an operation, although it
        should be absolutely certain that this surgeon was the only
        person in India who could perform it, and that if it were not
        performed the person who required it would die. It is difficult
        to say whether a Penal Code which should put no omissions on the
        same footing with acts, or a Penal Code which should put all
        omissions on the same footing with acts would produce
        consequences more absurd and revolting. There is no country in
        which either of these principles is adopted. Indeed, it is hard
        to conceive how, if either were adopted, society could be held
        together. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <o:p style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</o:p><br
        style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[6] It is plain, therefore,
        that a middle course must be taken. But it is not easy to
        determine what that middle course ought to be. The absurdity of
        the two extremes is obvious. But there are innumerable
        intermediate points; and wherever the line of demarcation may be
        drawn it will, we fear, include some cases which we might wish
        to exempt, and will exempt some which we might wish to include.
      </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <o:p style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</o:p><br
        style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[7] Mr Livingston's Code
        provides that a person shall be considered as guilty of homicide
        who omits to save life, which he could save "without personal
        danger or pecuniary loss." This rule appears to us to be open to
        serious objection. There may be extreme inconvenience without
        the smallest personal danger, or the smallest risk of pecuniary
        loss; as in the case which we lately put of a surgeon summoned
        from Calcutta to Meerut to perform an operation. He may be
        offered such a fee that he would be a gainer by going. He may
        have no ground to apprehend that he should run any greater
        personal risk by journeying to the Upper Provinces than by
        continuing to reside in Bengal. But he is about to proceed to
        Europe immediately, or he expects some members of his family by
        the next ship, and wishes to be at the presidency to receive
        them. He, therefore, refuses to go. Surely, he ought not, for so
        refusing, to be treated as a murderer. It would be somewhat
        inconsistent to punish one man for not staying three months in
        India to save the life of another, and to leave wholly
        unpunished a man who, enjoying ample wealth, should refuse to
        disburse an anna [a coin of small value, 1/16th of a rupee--JA]
        to save the life of another. Again, it appears to us that it may
        be fit to punish a person as a murderer for causing death by
        omitting an act which cannot be performed without personal
        danger or pecuniary loss. A parent may be unable to procure food
        for an infant without money. Yet the parent, if he has the
        means, is bound to furnish the infant with food, and if by
        omitting to do so he voluntarily causes its death, he may with
        propriety be treated as a murderer. A nurse hired to attend a
        person suffering from an infectious disease cannot perform her
        duty without running some risk of infection. Yet if she deserts
        the sick person, and thus voluntarily causes his death, we
        should be disposed to treat her as a murderer. </span><br
        style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <o:p style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</o:p><br
        style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[8] We pronounce with
        confidence therefore that the line ought not to be drawn where
        Mr Livingston has drawn it. But it is with great diffidence that
        we bring forward our own proposition. It is open to objections:
        cases may be put in which it will operate too severely, and
        cases in which it will operate too leniently; but we are unable
        to devise a better. </span><br style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <o:p style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</o:p><br
        style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[9] What we propose is this,
        that where acts are made punishable on the ground that they have
        caused, or have been intended to cause, or have been known to be
        likely to cause a certain evil effect, omissions which have
        caused, which have been intended to cause, or which have been
        known to be likely to cause the same effect shall be punishable
        in the same manner; provided that such omissions were, on other
        grounds, illegal. An omission is illegal (see clause 28 [not
        included here]) if it be an offence, if it be a breach of some
        direction of law, or if it be such a wrong as would be a good
        ground for a civil action. </span><br style="font-family:
        Georgia;">
      <o:p style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</o:p><br
        style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[10] We cannot defend this
        rule better than by giving a few illustrations of the way in
        which it will operate. A omits to give Z food, and by that
        omission voluntarily causes Z's death. Is this murder? Under our
        rule it is murder if A was Z's jailer, directed by the law to
        furnish Z with food. It is murder if Z was the infant child of
        A, and had therefore a legal right to sustenance, which right a
        civil court would enforce against A. It is murder if Z was a
        bedridden invalid, and A a nurse hired to feed Z. It is murder
        if A was detaining Z in unlawful confinement, and had thus
        contracted (see clause 338 [not included here]) a legal
        obligation to furnish Z, during the continuance of the
        confinement, with necessaries. It is not murder if Z is a beggar
        who has no other claim on A than that of humanity. </span><br
        style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <o:p style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</o:p><br
        style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[11] A omits to tell Z that a
        river is swollen so high that Z cannot safely attempt to ford
        it, and by this omission voluntarily causes Z's death. This is
        murder if A is a peon stationed by authority to warn travellers
        from attempting to ford the river. It is murder if A is a guide
        who had contracted to conduct Z. It is not murder if A is a
        person on whom Z has no other claim than that of humanity. </span><br
        style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <o:p style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</o:p><br
        style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[12] A savage dog fastens on
        Z; A omits to call off the dog, knowing that if the dog be not
        called off it is likely that Z will be killed. Z is killed. This
        is murder in A, if the dog belonged to A, inasmuch as his
        omission to take proper order with the dog is illegal (clause
        273). But if A be a mere passer-by it is not murder. </span><br
        style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <o:p style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</o:p><br
        style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[13] We are sensible that in
        some of the cases which we have put, our rule may appear too
        lenient. But we do not think that it can be made more severe
        without disturbing the whole order of society. It is true that
        the man who, having abundance of wealth, suffers a fellow
        creature to die of hunger at his feet, is a bad man -- a worse
        man, probably, than many of those for whom we have provided very
        severe punishment. But we are unable to see where, if we make
        such a man legally punishable, we can draw the line. If the rich
        man who refuses to save a beggar's life at the cost of a little
        copper is a murderer, is the poor man just one degree above
        beggary also to be a murderer if he omits to invite the beggar
        to partake his hard earned rice? Again, if the rich man is a
        murderer for refusing to save the beggar's life at the cost of a
        little copper, is he also to be a murderer if he refuses to save
        the beggar's life at the cost of a thousand rupees? Suppose A to
        be fully convinced that nothing can save Z's life, unless Z
        leave Bengal and reside a year at the Cape; is A, however
        wealthy he may be, to be punished as a murderer because he will
        not at his own expense send Z to the Cape? Surely not. Yet it
        will be difficult to say on what principle we can punish A for
        not spending an anna to save Z's life, and leave him unpunished
        for not spending a thousand rupees to save Z's life. The
        distinction between a legal and an illegal omission is perfectly
        plain and intelligible. But the distinction between a large and
        a small sum of money is very far from being so; not to say that
        a sum which is small to one man is large to another. </span><br
        style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <o:p style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</o:p><br
        style="font-family: Georgia;">
      <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[14] The same argument holds
        good in the case of the ford. It is true that none but a very
        depraved man would suffer another to be drowned when he might
        prevent it by a word. But if we punish such a man, where are we
        to stop? How much exertion are we to require? Is a person to be
        a murderer if he does not go fifty yards through the sun of
        Bengal at noon in May in order to caution a traveller against a
        swollen river? Is he to be a murderer if he does not go a
        hundred yards? -- if he does not go a mile? -- if he does not go
        ten? What is the precise amount of trouble and inconvenience
        which he is to endure? The distinction between the guide who is
        bound to conduct the traveller as safely as he can, and a mere
        stranger, is a clear distinction. But the distinction between a
        stranger who will not give a halloo [a shout of warning--JA] to
        save a man's life, and a stranger who will not run a mile to
        save a man's life, is very far from being equally clear. </span><br

      <span style="font-family: Georgia;">[15] It is, indeed, most
        highly desirable that men should not merely abstain from doing
        harm to their neighbours, but should render active services to
        their neighbours. In general, however, the penal law must
        content itself with keeping men from doing positive harm, and
        must leave to public opinion, and to the teachers of morality
        and religion, the office of furnishing men with motives for
        doing positive good. It is evident that to attempt to punish men
        by law for not rendering to others all the service which it is
        their duty to render to others would be preposterous. We must
        grant impunity to the vast majority of those omissions which a
        benevolent morality would pronounce reprehensible, and must
        content ourselves with punishing such omissions only when they
        are distinguished from the rest by some circumstance which marks
        them out as peculiarly fit objects of penal legislation. Now, no
        circumstance appears to us so well fitted to be the mark as the
        circumstance which we have selected. It will generally be found
        in the most atrocious cases of omission; it will scarcely ever
        be found in a venial case of omission; and it is more clear and
        certain than any other mark that has occurred to us. That there
        are objections to the line which we propose to draw, we have
        admitted. But there are objections to every line which can be
        drawn and some line must be drawn.</span><o:p
