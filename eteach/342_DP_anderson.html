<hr style="margin-left: 80px;" size="1" width="88%">
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;<br>
</div>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">He is an
instinctual killer, the government believes, a Vegas hit
man, a "poster child for the death penalty" who learned how effortless
murder can
be when he caught a bird as a young man and crushed it in his palm
without
a second thought. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Years later, after
he shot a grandmother in the face, prosecutors
say, he cooked himself noodles in her kitchen and poured himself a
glass of milk
while she died. He would say later that he made just two mistakes: not
getting
out of the house sooner, and not trying to shoot his way past the cops
once
he was caught. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">That's half the
story. Stephen Wayne Anderson, 48, scheduled to die
by
lethal injection Tuesday morning at San Quentin State Prison, also has
an
IQ of 136. Beaten as a boy, disowned at 17 and forced to live outdoors
and
alone in the hills of New Mexico, he has become an accomplished poet,
writing
behind bars about the smell of honeysuckle and the wind tickling the
trees
in the fall. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">His supporters say
he made up the hit man stuff, and many law
enforcement officials are starting to agree. Friends say he never meant
to kill, that he is the hapless target of cowboy prosecutors determined
to see San Bernardino County's first death penalty case in 40 years to
its ultimate conclusion. For the first time in California, his victims'
survivors unanimously support his bid for clemency. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">His trial attorney
was so incompetent that two other killers
represented by the same man have had their death sentences thrown out.
He is the linchpin of allegations that Gov. Gray Davis should no longer
address clemency pleas because he has never agreed to one--and has
suggested that he never will in
a murder case. Indeed, Davis denied Anderson's clemency bid Saturday,
saying
there is "no question of his guilt." </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">All told,
Anderson's is one of the most convoluted cases to emerge
from San Quentin, and is emblematic of the passion--and
ambivalence--surrounding the debate over government-sponsored
execution. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"This one," said
Robert S. Horwitz, one of the lawyers fighting for
an
unlikely eleventh-hour reprieve, "has a lot of baggage." </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">With the
governor's decision this weekend, it is now virtually
certain that Anderson will be put to death early Tuesday. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Prison workers
will open the tap of an intravenous line, delivering
three
drugs into Anderson's bloodstream. Each is lethal on its own. When
served
as a cocktail, they are more than sufficient. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Anderson, bearded
and portly with an easy smile, would be the 10th
man executed in California since voters reinstated capital punishment
in 1978. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Meantime, in the
days leading to the execution, two strikingly
different portraits of Anderson have emerged. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">There is the
yin--the premeditated murderer who may have killed as
many as nine people, who once befriended a prison guard, then told his
new pal he'd kill him in a jiffy if it meant escaping from custody. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">And there is the
yang--the troubled, railroad-hopping hobo who
blossomed into a poet and an intellectual, the fumbling burglar who
fired his gun in
the dark only when he panicked. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The surprising
footprint of Anderson's case on those who have come
in contact
with him began the very night he was arrested. It was Memorial Day
1980.
A San Bernardino County sheriff's deputy drove him away from a small
home
in Bloomington, an unincorporated community near Fontana, where he'd
just
shot and killed 81-year-old Elizabeth Lyman, a retired piano teacher. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Anderson asked
whether California enforced the death penalty. "I
hope so,"
he said. "I want out of this mess." </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">A homeless drifter
who was riding the rails after escaping prison in
Utah,
where he was being held on several burglary charges, Anderson landed in
Bloomington
in spring 1980. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">After casing the
house of his victim for two days, he was sure no
one was
home--mostly because he saw no car in the driveway, his legal team has
argued.
But Lyman did not have a car, and she was inside. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">On May 26,
Anderson drank a pint of vodka, according to his lawyers,
and
then, shortly after midnight, spent an hour prying the hinges off the
door. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">When he walked
into the bedroom, looking for cash, Lyman rose from
her sleep. Anderson turned and shot her under the left eye with a
.45-caliber handgun. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Authorities say he
had taped down the gun's safety to ensure that it
would
fire quickly. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Then, law
enforcement officers say--though it's one of many disputed
facts
in the case--he fixed himself a bowl of noodles. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"He simply made
himself at home," David Whitney, San Bernardino
County's lead deputy district attorney, wrote to the governor earlier
this month. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Said Wes Daw, one
of the original investigators in the case: "His
hunger outweighed his conscience." </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Anderson does not
dispute charges that he pulled the trigger, though
his
supporters argue that instead of carrying out a premeditated killing,
he
panicked and shot wildly in the dark when Lyman rose from her bed. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">When deputies
arrived, Anderson chuckled about how he'd been caught
in
someone else's home in the middle of the night wearing dark clothes and
gloves.
Not exactly a tough case to crack. Authorities suspect Anderson stabbed
a
fellow inmate to death in 1977 in Utah, escaped custody and in 1980
shot
a man to death in a murder-for-hire and killed six others while
operating
as a "hit man" in Las Vegas. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Defense lawyers
argue that none of it ever happened. They say
Anderson was probably involved only in the death of the inmate, Robert
Blundell, and
even that, they argue, was self-defense. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Anderson now
denies the crimes, and his defense team believes he
delivered "false confessions" to the murders-for-hire because he was
suicidal after being arrested in the Lyman murder. Authorities concede
that they've never been able to prove that the "hit man" murders even
occurred. Still, Whitney cited all of it in his letter asking that the
execution proceed as planned. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"As some of the
officers have put it, he's a poster child for the
death penalty," Whitney said in an interview. "It's not about what's
best for the
defendant." </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">That may be the
only thing the two sides agree on. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h4 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"> Victims'
Relatives Request Clemency</h4>
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Relatives of
Lyman and Blundell wrote letters supporting Anderson's bid
for
clemency--asking that his sentence be commuted to life in prison
without possibility
of parole.
</span>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"While we deeply
miss our son and brother ... executing Stephen
Anderson will not replace our loss nor bring us any relief," Blundell's
mother, Lois
Smith, wrote to court officials last year. "We do not want or need
Stephen
Anderson to die for the death of our loved one." </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">So who wants
Anderson to die, besides the prosecution? </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The answer, his
attorneys claim, is no one. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"That should be
something that would weigh in this," said Marie
Stratton, the Los Angeles-based federal public defender. <br>
<br>
</p>
<h4 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"> 'We Let Juries
and Courts Decide'</h4>
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Whitney scoffed
at the argument, asserting that his "client" is the
public.
</span>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"We let juries and
courts decide," he said. "Murders are cases
against the state, against society in general." </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Anderson also has
been the focus of an unusual appeal in which his
attorneys argued that Davis should recuse himself from clemency
requests. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The governor has
rejected recommendations that dozens of killers be
released
from prison, and he has now thrown out all four clemency petitions he
has
received in the last three years. In interviews, Davis has said that
"if
you take someone else's life, forget it." </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"No mercy," Margo
Rocconi, another Anderson lawyer, told corrections
officials
earlier this month. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Ward Campbell, a
supervising deputy attorney general in Sacramento,
said
in an interview that courts have ruled that even if Davis had a blanket
policy
against clemency, that would not violate the Constitution. No one has
proven
that the governor has such a policy, he said, and a federal appeals
court
agreed Friday. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Anderson's defense
team also laments his representation--or lack
thereof--by S. Donald Ames, a flamboyant San Bernardino County attorney
who died two years
ago. The court appointed Ames to represent Anderson because the
defendant had no money. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Federal judges
have commuted two other death sentences to life
prison terms
because of Ames' work. In those cases, federal judges found that being
represented
by Ames was "the equivalent of no counsel at all." Ames once said his
own
client "deserves to fry." </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Preparation,
Anderson's attorneys have wrote, "was something of
which Mr.
Ames was congenitally incapable." </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Ames also said
Anderson refused to give him names of witnesses to
call when the jury was weighing the death penalty. According to federal
judges who investigated, Ames' own notes indicate that Anderson gave
the attorney the names of many witnesses. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Most importantly,
Ames did not delve into Anderson's past, which,
his supporters
say, explains quite a bit. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Born to a coal
miner's daughter and an alcoholic oil worker,
Anderson and
his younger brother, Ken, were beaten as children, according to
Anderson's clemency appeal. The family was unable to afford food at
times. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"I dreaded the
days that you boys were born," their mother, Goldie,
told
her sons. She told neighbors that she preferred her dogs to her
children. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Anderson learned
to protect his brother from their parents. Because
their
mother would get upset when young Ken soiled his diaper, Anderson
learned
to change diapers. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">That pattern would
continue. In 1971, Stephen, afraid for his
brother's safety, took the blame when Ken threw a party at their
Farmington, N.M., home. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"If Stevie had
tried to hit back I think Dad would have killed him,"
Ken
wrote in court documents. "Finally ... he screamed at him to pack his
bags
and get out of the house." </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Anderson camped in
the hills surrounding town. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"I just don't
think he ever had a chance," Rocconi said. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Jurors weighing
whether the state should execute Anderson learned
little about his past, his new attorneys say. Three jurors have written
the state, saying they would have voted for life in prison if they had
learned more about
Anderson's background. One said she remains haunted by the case.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h4 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"> Wrote
Award-Winning Poems and Essays</h4>
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Deputy Dist.
Atty. Whitney defended Ames, saying he was a friend and
"one of the better defense attorneys in our county."
</span>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">In December, 19
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judges ruled that Ames
did
not violate Anderson's right to a fair trial. Six judges disagreed. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"If the courts
appoint incompetent counsel ... we should not then
compound that judicial error by permitting the state to execute the
ill-represented defendant," they wrote. "The system has now failed
doubly in Stephen Anderson's case." </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Anderson will
leave behind hundreds of award-winning poems and
essays--and a powerful connection with people who helped him through an
intellectual resurrection.
Many of his works delved into his extensive time spent behind bars,
including
a 1993 piece called "Stone": </p>
<blockquote style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Barely
remaining sane, he wept demanding release; yet
somehow he knew those shouts were in vain. Sinners such as him were
granted no peace.
So, trapped between agony and pride ... he wept upon a concrete bed,
remembering
all the mistakes he'd made.</blockquote>
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"He was totally
different from what I expected, in his intelligence,
his talent and his sensitivity to other people," Horwitz said.
</span>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">None of these
issues, his supporters concede, make Anderson a saint.
But
they are enough, they argue, to have spared him from execution and
condemn
him instead to life in prison. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Bell Chevigny, a
volunteer with a prison-writing program in New York
who
edited an anthology that included an Anderson piece, began
corresponding with
him through letters regularly in the late 1990s. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"He is the most
peaceful and compassionate person," she said through
tears.
"I think the state's humanity falls short of his at this point." </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Davis disagreed
Saturday in a 34-page document denying clemency,
saying Anderson is indeed smart--smart enough to know better. </p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Anderson, the
governor wrote, "is an extremely intelligent man. But
his
intelligence, ironically, also makes the brutality and indifference of
his
crimes all the more reprehensible." <br>
