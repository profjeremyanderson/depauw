<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[1]&nbsp; Studies
have shown that blows to the head cause boxers chronic
brain damage, due to the rapid movement of the brain within the skull,
tearing vessels and nerve fibers.(1) Nor are those who suffer knockouts
the only fighters at risk for brain damage: "the number of bouts rather
than knockouts correlates best with the development of chronic brain
damage."(2)
64-87% of current and former boxers tested in studies done in the 1980s
suffered from measurable brain damage, leading Robert Glenn Morrison to
conclude that "the evidence is indisputable that modern boxers do
suffer
brain damage as a result of their profession, despite improved safety
standards."(3)
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[2]&nbsp;
Interestingly, while any death from boxing is a tragedy, it
appears that the risk of death is fairly remote. For instance, in
absolute
numbers, fewer boxers died in various time periods and places than
participants
in such other sports as American football and baseball. And the number
of deaths per 1,000 participants is similar to or lower than the
numbers
for such other high-risk sports as mountaineering and motorcycle
racing.(4)
The risk of such injuries as cuts, bone fractures, and damage to the
cornea
and retina is much greater. However, since these injuries are generally
treatable and rarely if ever debilitating, debate over whether we
should
ban boxing has focused on the problem of brain damage. Largely due to
its
concern over the risk of brain damage, in 1984 the American Medical
Association
House of Delegates proposed that professional and amateur boxing be
banned.(5)
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[3]&nbsp; This
paper is devoted to examining arguments supporting the
ban on boxing proposed by the AMA. My major focus will be on
professional
boxing, because, with its longer fights and greater tolerance of
punishment
of fighters before bouts are stopped, it is more dangerous than amateur
boxing, and also because only the professional sport raises questions
about
the autonomy of decisions to risk injury in order to gain untold
wealth.
Because his fierce defense of the liberal view--"[t]he harm and offense
principles, duly clarified and qualified, between them exhaust the
class
of good reasons for criminal prohibitions"--provides such a stringent
test
of any proposal to restrict liberty, I will make extensive reference
throughout
this paper to Joel Feinberg's arguments against legal paternalism and
legal
moralism in his monumental work, The Moral Limits of the Criminal
Law.(6)
I will conclude that we should impose a single legal restriction that
would
effectively eliminate boxing's main medical risk: a complete ban on
blows
to the head.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">1. Paternalistic
Arguments for Restricting Boxing
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[4]&nbsp; The most
obvious rationale for restricting boxing is to protect
boxers from harm. The initial paternalistic case for prohibition--that
is, that the risks of brain damage are so severe that we have a duty to
protect fighters from the harm that they are likely to suffer--falls
foul
of Mill's famous defense of individual freedom in On Liberty. According
to Mill, we should respect the right of autonomous adults to exercise
their
ability to rationally guide their behavior by their own freely chosen
values.
To interfere with the career choices of adults who wish to take up
boxing
is wrong, on this view, because it treats them as children and not as
autonomous
beings.(7) To justify restricting boxing, then, we need to turn to more
sophisticated paternalistic arguments.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[5]&nbsp; The
entire paternalism v. respect for autonomy debate as it
applies to boxing is cast in nonconsequentialist terms. Confining our
attention
to the results of boxing for the fighters, a cost-benefit analysis
seems
to indicate that the utilities are stacked overwhelmingly against
allowing
boxing. In return for the psychological benefits of being allowed to
live
according to their own lights, and the minuscule chance of becoming
rich,
boxers face the likelihood of irreversible brain damage. The
proautonomy,
anti-governmental interference view gains its strength not from the
claim
that it will produce the best results for boxers, but rather from the
claim
that boxers should be free to act on their own decisions, even if those
decisions will probably end up hurting them.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">a. Soft
Paternalism
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[6]&nbsp; Even the
liberal view, though, as defended by Mill and Feinberg,
allows for paternalistic restrictions in the case of people whose
decisions
lack autonomy, for example, children, the mentally ill, and people
acting
under duress or in predicaments. In such cases, respect for autonomy
may
actually require paternalistic intervention. Following standard usage,
let us call paternalism to protect people from the results of
inautonomous
requests or actions "soft paternalism," in contrast to "hard
paternalism,"
which permits interference with fully voluntary, autonomous requests or
actions. The question we have to consider, then, is whether we have any
reason to suspect that boxers' decisions to enter the profession are
lacking
in autonomy.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[7]&nbsp; Many
boxers probably fail to clear the very first hurdle required
for an autonomous decision: having adequate information. Boxers are
unlikely
to have subscriptions to the Journal of the American Medical
Association,
whose detailed accounts of the medical dangers of their profession are
cited above, while promoters, managers, and trainers have a vested
interest
in not drawing their potential breadwinners' attention to information
that
might deter them from entering the ring. At best, the majority of
boxers
are aware that some fighters have died in the ring, and that some have
suffered serious injuries, but they likely share--doubtless due to an
understatement
of risks on the part of the boxing business as well as their own
self-deception--the
popular misconception that brain damage is a rare occurrence that
happens
only to fighters who suffer repeated knockouts. However, boxers'
ignorance
of the full extent of the dangers of prizefighting will not persuade
the
liberal to support prohibition. A far better remedy, according to the
liberal
view, would be to institute mandatory education on these
dangers--supervised
by a neutral boxing commission that has no financial stake in
minimizing
the risks--as one of the requirements for receiving a boxing license.
These
educational programs should also include detailed information on the
likely
career earnings of boxers and the very low percentage of fighters who
ever
reach the level of lucrative title fights. Such an approach, which
parallels
government health warnings on cigarette packs and bottles of alcohol,
would
enable boxers to make autonomous decisions and would show maximal
respect
for their autonomy.(8)
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[8]&nbsp; A far
stronger paternalistic argument arises from the fact
that an autonomous decision must flow from the agent's own values,
without
undue pressure from other people or external circumstances. When such
pressure
is too great, it becomes coercive and precludes autonomous action. In
this
light, we must consider the argument that since boxers often come from
severely disadvantaged backgrounds and may see boxing as their only
means
of escaping from dangerous, poverty-stricken neighborhoods, their
decision
to become boxers may reflect their desperation, rather than an
authentic
desire that flows from their own considered values.(9) Can the offer of
a career in professional boxing ever be coercive?
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[9]&nbsp; The idea
of a coercive offer seems paradoxical, since an offer
that actually increases a person's options hardly seems capable of
forcing
him or her into an action. However, as Joel Feinberg has argued,
increasing
people's freedom is sometimes compatible with coercing them.(10) He
asks
us to consider the example of a millionaire who offers to pay for the
expensive
surgery necessary to save the life of a woman's child, on the condition
that the woman agree to have sexual relations with him for a period of
time. By hypothesis, the woman has no other means to save her child's
life.
In these circumstances, Feinberg suggests, the woman is indeed forced
to
do something she would far rather not do--have sex with a lecherous,
exploitative
stranger--by her desperate desire to save her child's life. From her
point
of view, the situation is just as coercive as one in which a man
kidnaps
her healthy child and threatens to kill him unless she agrees to have
sex
with the kidnapper.(11)
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[10]&nbsp; The
"lecherous millionaire" example belongs to the clearest
category of coercive offers: those in which the coerced person is
pressured
to choose an option she does not desire in order to avoid an
alternative
that she desires even less. The "differential coercive pressure" is
greatest
when the offered option is vastly less unattractive than the option
avoided
by taking up the offer. More difficult to categorize are situations in
which the offered option is mildly attractive in its own right to its
recipient.
Suppose, Feinberg asks us, that the woman with the dying child would
have
regarded an affair with the millionaire as somewhat desirable
independently
of his offer. (Let us assume for the sake of argument that her mild
attraction
to the millionaire is not destroyed by the crass opportunism of his
offer.)
In this event, he suggests, while the differential coercive pressure is
even greater than in the original example, making the offer even harder
to refuse, the fact that the woman would have had a mild desire to have
an affair with him regardless of the offer relegates this case to the
status
of "impure" coercion. The "coercive minimum"(12)--the degree of
unpleasantness
of the action that the offer induces the woman to perform--is
negligible
or even negative. The situation is coercive, but her choice is made
willingly,
and not because of the coercion.(13) One measure of the degree of
coercion
exerted by any given offer is a function of the amount of differential
coercive pressure and the unpleasantness of the coercive minimum.(14)
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[11]&nbsp; Into
which category--relatively harmless impure coercion
or morally problematic coercion--does the pull that boxing exerts on
poor
youths and adults fall? It all depends on the attitude that boxers take
toward their profession. There are doubtless some boxers who thoroughly
enjoy fighting and would do so anyway as members of amateur clubs even
if the rich rewards of professional boxing were unavailable. They may
be
driven by a variety of motivations: the desire to hurt and physically
dominate
opponents or gain the status of macho cult heroes, or pride in the
skill,
courage, and discipline that successful boxers require.(15) Such boxers
are subject only to morally innocuous impure coercion. I suspect that
the
majority of fighters, while they may share some of all of these
motives,
are more ambivalent toward their occupation. They regard the pain and
injuries
that they suffer, the damage that they inflict on opponents, and the
indignity
of performing in public in their underwear before a crowd that wants to
see at least one of the two fighters get hurt, as unpleasant
necessities
to be endured in order to achieve financial and physical security and
have
a shot at the rich rewards that are available to highly successful
boxers.
This is the likely attitude of the large number of boxers known as
"opponents,"
whose role is primarily to provide opposition for rising stars who are
working their way up through the ranks, compiling impressive win-loss
records
as they go. These opponents, who are an integral part of the boxing
world
(after all, not everyone can be a champion or contender), occasionally
score upset victories but are usually content to survive a fight and
collect
their paycheck with a minimal amount of injuries. That many fighters,
even
successful ones, harbor reservations about their profession is
strikingly
supported by Michael Burke in the context of his impassioned defense of
the sport as viewed by boxers themselves:
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[12]&nbsp; [T]he
quasi-religious link of the boxer to his craft is not
without tension, and sometimes resentment, which the fighters suggest
is
produced by the "barbaricness" (sic) of the sport, the grind and
torture
of the body resulting in its breakdown, the physical abuse of self and
others, and the ruthless and despotic exploitation of the boxer by his
manager and controllers for the enjoyment of others. The boxers
understand
it as a coerced affection, a poor man's love ... There are no rich,
white
boxers in the semi-professional game ... Boxers leave parts of
themselves
in the ring. The body which has been trained and disciplined to perform
the "sweet craft" does not survive intact. The contradiction in this
ruination
of the cherished masculine body creates a further ambivalence toward
boxing.
As a result, the overwhelming majority of boxers [in the study by Lois
Wacquant that Burke cites], who speak of the love of their craft, do
not
want their sons to follow in their footsteps ... Therefore, the boxers'
passion is a skewed and malicious one. It is tainted by the idea that
boxing,
for all of its benefits, exacts too high a price.(16)
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[13]&nbsp; For
such boxers, plying their trade requires that they endure
a coercive minimum of varying degrees of unpleasantness and grave
doubts
therefore arise about the autonomy of their decision to enter the ring.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[14]&nbsp; If
boxers are primarily motivated by the intrinsic enjoyment
that they gain from the activity, we would expect that they would be
evenly
distributed throughout all socioeconomic classes. The reality that the
vast majority of fighters come from poor backgrounds lends credence to
the claim that economic motivations are the primary ones for their
choice
of occupation. As Colin Radford, a defender of boxing, concedes,
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[15]&nbsp; for
most boxers .... boxing was their only escape from hard
labor--or, as it is more likely to be these days, unemployment.
(Whether
a country has a lot of good boxers, or few, is a pretty good indicator
of the state of its economy, or of the economic opportunities available
to some community within that country.)(17)
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[16]&nbsp; The
very small number of fighters who come from affluent
backgrounds would not be subject to coercion at all, but, for the
majority
of the others, the offer of boxing contracts creates a strong
differential
coercive pressure with a more or less significant coercive minimum. A
plausible
soft paternalist argument for restricting boxing, then, is to protect
boxers--those
who regard fighting as an unpleasant necessity in order to escape
poverty--from
acting on inautonomous decisions.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[17]&nbsp;
However, does the argument just presented not have the unfortunate
consequence that all offers of menial work, which often brings little
intrinsic
satisfaction and is performed largely out of economic necessity, are
coercive?
In response, while a Marxist would indeed regard the need to find a job
in a capitalist society as coercive, no particular job offer is
coercive.
The reason I have singled out the offer of a career in boxing as
coercive
is that it provides a unique opportunity for a slim chance of vast
wealth
and, thus, exerts vastly greater differential coercive pressure than
the
prospect of poorly-paid menial jobs. Moreover, for many fighters boxing
exacts a far more burdensome coercive minimum than unskilled jobs in
order
to enjoy the rewards: physical pain, the risk of serious injury, and
moral
qualms about injuring opponents, as opposed to the tedium of menial
jobs.
When, as in the case of most minimum-wage jobs, the coercive minimum
that
an offer induces a person to perform is only mildly unpleasant, little
if any coercion occurs. Similarly, the view that people can be coerced
by offers to become professional boxers does not entail that lucrative
contracts for such other sports as basketball would also be coercive
for
youths from disadvantaged backgrounds. While such offers may indeed be
hard to refuse, basketball contracts impose negative coercive minimums
and are, therefore, only impurely coercive. For most people, accepting
such contacts would impose no costs at all, since they regard playing
basketball
as a positively pleasant experience. Hence offers of professional
boxing
contracts can be coercive in a way that offers of minimum wage jobs and
professional basketball contracts are not.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[18]&nbsp;
However, Feinberg argues that the coerciveness of an offer
does not necessarily invalidate its recipient's consent. When the
coercer
deliberately creates the situation that makes the coercee unable to
refuse
the offer--for example, if the millionaire had actually caused the
child's
illness that now requires expensive medical care--the coercee's consent
is indeed involuntary and invalid. But when the coercer merely takes
advantage
of the coercee's pre-existing predicament--and such is clearly the case
for any coercion that promoters, managers, and trainers exert over
those
whom they persuade to become professional boxers--their exploitation
does
not preclude an autonomous decision by the coercee to accept the
offer.(18)
Since boxing promoters, managers, or trainers, who are not the cause of
a potential fighter's socioeconomic disadvantages, merely provide him
with
an opportunity to overcome those disadvantages, he can surely make a
voluntary
decision to accept their offer as the best (though unfortunate)
solution
to a sorry situation.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[19]&nbsp;
Nonetheless, even though exploitative coercers who take advantage
of their coercees' pre-existing predicaments do not normally prevent
coercees
from voluntarily accepting their offers, Feinberg concedes that in the
case of "unconscionable contracts," coercees' voluntariness may be so
impaired
as to make their consent to the contract invalid.(19) An offer is
unconscionable
when it is coercive and imposes harsh conditions on the coercee or
confers
unfair benefits on the coercer. Feinberg argues that the lecherous
millionaire's
offer is unconscionable if the woman is coerced into sexual relations,
which constitutes a harsh cost for her. This unconscionability reduces
her voluntariness in consenting to the agreement to a level that
renders
it null and void. If she broke the agreement once the millionaire had
paid
for her child's medical care, courts should dismiss his claim for
compensation
for her breach of contract.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[20]&nbsp; Since
offers to become professional boxers are sometimes
coercive, and since the medical evidence cited at the outset of this
paper
gives ample reason to consider the costs imposed on boxers as harsh,
these
offers therefore do indeed sometimes qualify as unconscionable. Does
the
unconscionability of the contracts that boxers sign reduce boxers'
voluntariness
to a sufficiently low level to justify outlawing such agreements? By
analogy
with Feinberg's treatment of the lecherous millionaire example, if the
contracts are unconscionable, courts would be justified in denying
promoters
et al. any legal recourse should a boxer break a contract. And the same
reasoning--protecting boxers from the effects of agreements to which
they
have not given sufficiently voluntary consent--justifies pre-emptive
protection
of boxers, in the form of banning such contracts in the first place. In
the case of the lecherous millionaire, we could allow the woman to
benefit
from the offer (since denying her the opportunity to save her child
seems
wrong) and then protect her from the millionaire's harsh demand by
declaring
the agreement void on the ground of its unconscionability when he sues
her after she refuses to fulfill her end of the contract. In contrast,
in the case of boxing the benefits are inseparable from the unduly
harsh
cost: the only way that boxers can enjoy the chance of earning a
fortune
in the ring is by simultaneously risking the probability of
irreversible
brain damage. Consequently, the only way we can protect boxers from the
effects of unconscionable contracts is to prohibit such contracts.(20)
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[21]&nbsp; Since
some boxers--those who are not socioeconomically disadvantaged
and those who find fighting intrinsically enjoyable and do not
experience
its hardships as costs--may make fully voluntary decisions to become
boxers,
restricting boxing would reduce their freedom in order to protect
others
from the effects of inautonomous decisions. While this interference is
regrettable, it is justified by the need to protect the large number of
fighters who currently enter the ring under varying degrees of de facto
coercion. In defense of a cautious, paternalistic approach, since
boxers
run the risk of serious, irreversible harm, we are entitled to demand a
high standard of autonomy before we allow them to do so.(21) Given the
socioeconomic realities in which most fighters enter the profession and
given the brutality that most fighters regard as a necessary
unpleasantness
to be endured, many of them do not meet that standard, and we are
entitled
to restrict boxing in order to protect them.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">b. Pre-Emptive
Paternalism
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[22]&nbsp; If the
previous soft paternalistic argument fails, on the
ground that many or most boxers do indeed choose their profession
autonomously,
the case for restricting boxing in order to protect boxers from harm
will
have to resort to the far more controversial principle of hard
paternalism:
the permissibility of interfering with people's fully autonomous
choices
in order to protect them from harm.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[23]&nbsp; The
most defensible type of hard paternalism was originally
proposed by John Stuart Mill, in the context of his famous
anti-paternalistic
argument in On Liberty. Mill argues that we are permitted to prevent
people
from acting on their desire to become slaves, even in the unlikely
event
that their decision is fully voluntary.(22) Mill points out the irony
of
letting our desire to respect people's freedom to live their lives
according
to their own values lead us to permit people to perform a single act,
however
voluntarily, that would irrevocably relinquish this freedom. If
autonomy
really is important, we are surely justified in this minor restriction
on people's current autonomy in order to prevent the complete loss of
autonomy
that occurs in slavery. We could compare this paternalistic restriction
with the act of pruning a tree in order to facilitate its future
growth.
Let us call restrictions on autonomous actions in order to preserve
greater
future autonomy pre-emptive paternalism.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[24]&nbsp; If
pre-emptive paternalism is ever justified, restricting
boxing seems to fall well within its rationale. According to the recent
studies cited above, most boxers will suffer from irreversible brain
damage,
and brain damage is the most direct way to reduce a person's autonomy.
And preemptive paternalism itself seems to be well established in our
legal
system, since it is the most obvious rationale for our prohibition on
dangerous,
addictive drugs and our laws requiring the use of car seat belts and
motorcycle
safety helmets.(23) A landmark judicial opinion on informed consent
recognized,
on the same ground of pre-emptive paternalism, that exceptions to
physicians'
normal duty of disclosure exist in the case of currently autonomous
patients
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[25]&nbsp; when
risk-disclosure poses such a threat of detriment to
the patient as to become unfeasible or contraindicated from a medical
point
of view. It is recognized that patients occasionally become so ill or
emotionally
distraught on disclosure as to foreclose a rational decision.(24)
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[26]&nbsp; Boxers
face a considerably higher probability of autonomy-reducing
injuries than do automobile drivers and motorcycle riders, whom we
already
protect with paternalistic laws. For instance, whereas motorcycle
riders
face a relatively small lifetime risk (2%) of serious injury or
death,(25)
we have seen that boxers face the probability of brain damage.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[27]&nbsp;
However, we need to consider Feinberg's powerful and original
critique of any pre-emptive paternalism.(26) He insists that we should
respect a fully autonomous decision to embark on a course of action
that
a person knows may result in a loss of autonomy. While liberty is
obviously
the central value that the liberal position is designed to protect,
"liberty
too is a means to a person's good which a sovereign chooser might
voluntarily
decide to trade off for some other value."(27) Even though a fully
voluntary
decision to risk the probability of a loss of future autonomy may lead
to a life with diminished autonomy,
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[28]&nbsp; it
would be an autonomously chosen life in any case, and
to interfere with its choice would be to infringe the chooser's
autonomy
at the time he makes the choice, that is to treat him in a manner
precluded
by respect for him as an autonomous agent.(28)
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[29]&nbsp;
Feinberg argues that we must give priority to the autonomous
wishes of my current self, even if I explicitly "disenfranchise" my
future
self by waiving my right to revoke my decision.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[30]&nbsp; [T]he
earlier choice, being the genuine choice of a sovereign
being, free to dispose of his own lot in the future, must continue to
govern.
After all, the earlier self and the later are the same self, not
morally
distinct persons, but rather one person at different times.(29)
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[31]&nbsp;
Feinberg presents a reductio ad absurdum argument against
banning slavery on pre-emptive paternalistic grounds. He fears that the
rationale of preserving future autonomy would also justify banning
suicide
and euthanasia, imposing "a `Spartan regime' of enforced health and
hygiene"
including bans on fried food and smoking, and forbidding any agreements
that would commit a person to narrowing his or her future options.(30)
However, Feinberg's attempt to show that all pre-emptive paternalism
has
absurd consequences is vulnerable to several objections.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[32]&nbsp; First,
it does not entail a ban on suicide and euthanasia.
Calling death a curtailment of autonomy sounds odd, since the paradigm
case of losing autonomy is a living person whose ability to determine
her
own future is diminished. The harm that is inflicted by death, when it
is indeed harmful, is not so much loss of autonomy as the cancellation
of any future experiences at all. However, one might object, being
alive
is a necessary condition for exercising autonomy and the
autonomy-preserving
rationale for pre-emptive paternalism might, after all, require that we
prohibit suicide and euthanasia. In response, a crucial difference
exists
between suicide/euthanasia and the type of harm that I propose to
prevent
by preemptive paternalism. Whereas we may safely assume that boxers do
not desire the loss of future autonomy that they risk suffering,
terminally
ill people seek to end their own lives precisely because they no longer
value their burdensome existence, and regard the permanent loss of
their
autonomy as a release from suffering. Allowing suicide or euthanasia
is,
therefore, quite consistent with protecting people like boxers from
losses
of autonomy that they do not desire. But what about people who want to
become slaves, who presumably desire to irrevocably give up their
freedom?
Does not the view that I am defending have the embarrassing consequence
that we should allow such people to become slaves? We can, fortunately,
avoid this unwanted entailment. A good number of those who voluntarily
enter servitude are likely to come to regard their irreversible
relinquishment
of freedom as a terrible mistake, perhaps made in a moment of
recklessness
or depression. Terminally ill people are, by contrast, far less likely
to undergo changes of heart: most patients suffering from painful
terminal
or degenerative diseases will desire even more strongly to die as their
suffering increases, rather than being grateful to society for
forbidding
euthanasia, thus giving them the opportunity to change their minds
about
dying. Moreover, to anticipate a similar argument from Feinberg that I
endorse later in this section, the request to become a slave is so
self-destructive
as to create a presumption of irrationality in the requester.
Protecting
such incompetent people from inautonomous decisions outweighs the
occasional
injustice done to those who make genuinely autonomous requests to
become
slaves.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[33]&nbsp; Second,
it isn't clear why we can't distinguish between dramatic
differences in degree between different losses of future autonomy. A
boxer's
chronic brain damage over several decades is a far more serious loss of
autonomy than that suffered by a junk food eater whose capacity to
think
rationally is not at all diminished during a life that is less healthy
and slightly abbreviated as a result of unwise eating habits. Allowing
pre-emptive paternalism to prevent such catastrophic losses of future
autonomy
as irrevocable slavery agreements and irreversible brain damage caused
by boxing does not commit us to allowing paternalism to prevent trivial
reductions in future options, any more than the harm principle commits
us to draconian laws punishing such trivial harms to others as
rudeness.
A more appropriate comparison would be between boxing and a food that
was
known to cause irreversible brain damage in the majority of people who
eat it. Agreeing that we should indeed ban such a food would be a
relatively
easy bullet to bite for the proponent of restricting boxing on the
ground
of pre-emptive paternalism. The FDA already prohibits foods and drugs
that
are known to have far less dramatic harmful effects.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[34]&nbsp; Third,
even if using pre-emptive paternalism to ban slavery
does have the absurd consequences that Feinberg alleges, this does not
taint the parallel argument for restricting boxing, because of a
crucial
difference between the cases. Slavery is certainly a catastrophic
renunciation
of liberty that prevents slaves who live to regret their enslavement
from
acting on their newly formed values. But, unlike brain damage caused by
boxing, it does not impair slaves' ability to reflect on and form
values
and life plans in the first place, which is the most fundamental
element
of autonomy. Boxing is especially pernicious in that it impairs
intellectual
and moral autonomy, whereas slavery, repugnant though the permanent
relinquishment
of freedom of action is, does not impair slaves' ability to think for
themselves.
As pointed out above, precisely this desire to protect people from
irreversible
loss of intellectual and moral autonomy may well underlie our current
prohibition
on dangerous, addictive drugs and our laws requiring seat belts and
safety
helmets.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[35]&nbsp; So
pre-emptive paternalism provides a plausible rationale
for several of our current legal requirements and restrictions and, if
justified, it makes a strong case for restricting boxing. Restricting
boxing
on the ground of pre-emptive paternalism entails neither a
controversial
ban on suicide and euthanasia nor unduly invasive laws designed to
prevent
trivial losses of autonomy. And Feinberg's claim that all pre-emptive
paternalism
is a violation of competent adults' right to choose their own life
plans
depends on the controversial assertion that, even in the case of such
dangerous
activities as taking addictive drugs, driving without seat belts or
safety
helmets, and boxing, the autonomous decisions of my current self always
take precedence over my future self's intellectual and moral autonomy.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[36]&nbsp;
Feinberg argues that we may justify banning slavery contracts
and requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets on grounds other than
preemptive
paternalism. Even if we accept Feinberg's rejection of preemptive
paternalism,
we can construct parallel rationales for restricting boxing that do not
involve hard paternalism. The first argument is based on the premise
that
we should demand that people demonstrate an especially high level of
autonomy
before we allow them to engage in activities that create a substantial
risk of serious, irreversible harm. Feinberg reasons that we may refuse
to recognize slavery contracts, which involve the ultimate act of
permanently
renouncing one's autonomy, on the ground that inevitably fallible tests
for autonomy would wrongly allow some inautonomous people to become
slaves.(31)
On the same soft paternalist ground that is acceptable to liberals, we
could argue that, especially in light of the concerns about de facto
coercion
of fighters from disadvantaged backgrounds discussed above in section
1a,
any legal tests that we devise may be too inexact for us to be sure
that
boxers have displayed the requisite level of autonomy for us to allow
them
to risk irreversible brain damage. Second, in an argument that
anticipates
our harm principle-based discussion in section 3, Feinberg warns
against
recognizing slavery contracts on the further ground that society's
abandonment
of those people who are reckless enough to become slaves would send a
dangerous
message of indifference to the plight of others that could lead to a
general
decrease in care and compassion in our society.(32) Similarly, we could
justify restricting boxing by appealing to the moral insensitivity that
is caused by our government's willingness to let fighters suffer the
probability
of brain damage in their most likely unsuccessful pursuit of fame and
fortune.
Third, Feinberg justifies both the prohibition of slavery and laws
requiring
safety helmets for motorcyclists by appealing to the "psychic costs" to
other people who are distressed when they see or learn of those who are
harmed by the absence of such protective laws.(33) A parallel argument
would justify restricting boxing due to the distress and indignation it
causes to third parties. I do not endorse the second and third
arguments
for restricting boxing and I present them only to show that they are
entailed
by Feinberg's nonpaternalistic arguments for banning slavery and
requiring
the use of safety helmets.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[37]&nbsp; If, on
the other hand, we reject Feinberg's absolute opposition
to hard paternalism, we can combine the arguments for restricting
boxing
on the ground of pre-emptive paternalism presented in the current
section
with the soft paternalistic arguments of the previous section to
provide
a compelling case. If boxing creates the probability of a severe and
irreversible
loss of autonomy and if serious doubts exist about the autonomy of many
fighters' decisions to enter the profession in the first place, we
should
restrict the sport in order to protect them.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">2. Arguments Based
on Legal Moralism
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[38]&nbsp; Even if
we reject all paternalistic arguments for restricting
boxing, another ground for prohibition deserves consideration: the
objection
that professional boxing is morally repugnant. If so, fighters,
managers,
trainers, promoters, and fans alike are complicit in perpetrating or
supporting
an immorality. Why exactly is boxing morally wrong? It cannot be the
mere
fact that brain damage and other injuries are the probable result,
because
the consent of the participants arguably prevents these harms from
constituting
wrongs (though, as we have seen, whether many boxers' consent is fully
voluntary is doubtful). To locate any immorality in boxing we should
look
beyond the consequences of the actions involved and focus instead on
the
attitudes that these actions express. I will focus on the attitudes
displayed
by boxers and by fans.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[39]&nbsp; Boxing,
along with such offshoots as full-contact karate
and ultimate combat, is unique among sports in that competitors'
primary
goal is to incapacitate their opponents. American football players
sometimes
use the morally dubious tactic of legal but bone-shattering hits
designed
to intimidate and shake up star opponents and, better still, force them
out of the game. However, while this tactic may facilitate victory, the
goal of the game remains to score more points than the opponent. In
boxing,
in contrast, incapacitating the opponent--by knockout or technical
knockout--is
sufficient for victory. By far the most effective way to incapacitate
opponents
is by inflicting blows to the head, thus causing (at least) temporary
damage
to the brain. Even winning by points is best achieved by punching
opponents'
heads, making knockdowns--which judges often consider decisive in
awarding
a round to a fighter--more likely to occur, while also reducing
opponents'
ability to fight back.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[40]&nbsp; In
attempting to injure their opponents, boxers treat them
as mere objects to be disposed of in order to achieve victory. No
amount
of post-fight embraces and mutual congratulations can erase the savage,
brutal attitude that, for the duration of the fight, each displayed
toward
the other.(34) Whereas the usual wrongness of injuring another is
arguably
avoided by each fighter's consent to participate in an activity known
to
be dangerous, this consent in no way diminishes the inherent wrongness
of regarding another person as a subhuman object to be damaged.
Consider,
by analogy, a TV show (not too far removed from reality) in which
participants
hurl a torrent of racist, sexist, or homophobic abuse at other people.
The voluntary participation of these victims of abuse would not lessen
our moral repugnance at the attitude of contempt that the abusers
display.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[41]&nbsp; The
attitude of many spectators of boxing is just as problematic
as that of the boxers themselves. Spectators pay for the privilege of
watching
two half-naked humans in a ring attempt to incapacitate one another by
means of punches. "Purist" fans who appreciate the high level of skills
that a talented boxer displays no doubt exist, and even less
knowledgeable
fans can admire the genuine courage that fighters sometimes exhibit.
But
many fans are especially eager to see cuts, knockdowns, and
knockouts--that
is, pain and injury--often standing and baying with bloodlust when one
fighter gets in trouble. Promoter Mike Jacobs said in 1935 that he
looked
for fighters who injure opponents, because fans do not "come out to see
a tea party. They come to see a man hurt."(35) We have little reason to
believe that the majority of boxing fans today are any different. TV
promotions
for upcoming fights, which we may presume are based on market research
and designed to attract as many viewers as possible, highlight brutal
knockdowns
rather than deft footwork and adroit evasions of blows. Mike Tyson, for
all his misdeeds outside the ring and his failing powers within it,
still
commands more attention than nearly all other fighters because of his
ability
to inflict gruesome punishment on opponents. Sitting in comfortable
ringside
or living-room seats and reveling in the sight of one man hurting
another
is a paradigm case of the wonderful German word schadenfreude--pleasure
derived from another person's misfortune. That this attitude is
reprehensible
needs no argument. Indeed, it is not far removed from sadism.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[42]&nbsp; Legal
moralism is the principle that would allow us to prohibit
such "free-floating" evils,(36) even if (because of the consent of
those
who are adversely affected by them) no one is wronged by them. Legal
moralism
permits us to restrict actions solely on the ground of their
immorality,
even though they might be harmless.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[43]&nbsp; Legal
moralism is normally associated with a conservative
agenda, as in the case of its most famous proponent, Patrick Devlin,
who
argued for the continued legal prohibition of prostitution and
homosexuality
on the ground that these practices tend to cause social disintegration
by violating values held by the majority.(37) The problem with this
type
of legal moralism is that it gives blanket approval to the majority for
imposing groundless prejudices on minority groups.(38) Strictly
speaking,
this rationale for restricting liberty is not legal moralism at all,
since
it is based not on moral arguments as such, but on the desire to
preserve
prevailing morality. For this reason, Feinberg refers to it instead as
moral conservatism.(39) However, rejecting moral conservatism does not
entail rejecting the argument for restricting boxing presented above
based
on strict legal moralism (i.e., arguments that boxing is immoral,
regardless
of whether prevailing morality approves or disapproves of it). First,
let
us examine whether strict legal moralism is ever defensible.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[44]&nbsp;
Feinberg considers a graphic hypothetical example of a free-floating
evil--Kristol's imaginary gladiatorial contests held in Yankee Stadium,
ending in the death of the losing combatants(40)--which makes a good
prima
facie case for strict legal moralism.(41) If anything is so inherently
immoral, regardless of the voluntary participation of both fighters and
spectators, as to justify prohibition, such gladiatorial contests are.
A society that allowed such barbaric contests to occur would be so
morally
base that the knowledge that it at least held fast to the liberal ideal
of respect for individual autonomy would be small comfort. If this
example
allows a foot inside the door for strict legal moralism, may we not use
the same principle to justify restricting the brutal business of
professional
boxing, which differs from gladiatorial combat only in the severity of
the injuries inflicted? Granted, the difference in degree is huge--the
certainty of death for the losing gladiator v. the probability of brain
damage for both boxers if they fight many contests--but the morally
troubling
feature is the same in both cases: the infliction of pain and injury
for
the pleasure of onlookers.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[45]&nbsp;
Feinberg's strategy in responding to this attempted counter-example
to his liberal position is to argue that our intuition that we should
indeed
ban gladiatorial contests can be explained on grounds that are
perfectly
acceptable to the liberal, without resorting to strict legal moralism.
The kind of people whom we allow to delight in watching brutal displays
of maiming and homicide, he argues, are likely to show a similar,
callous
disregard for other people's welfare in their own private lives.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[46]&nbsp; We
cannot hold an image of these wretches in our minds without
recoiling, for each of them alone will seem threatening or dangerous,
and
thousands or millions of them together will be downright terrifying. It
is highly difficult, if not plain impossible, to think of widespread
indifference
to suffering as a mere private moral failing unproductive of further
individual
and social harm ... [M]oral corruption as such is not a relevant ground
for preventive criminalization, but when the moral dispositions that
are
corrupted include concern about the sufferings of others, then the
interests
of others become vulnerable, and the corrupting activity can no longer
be thought to be exclusively self-regarding.(42)
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[47]&nbsp; This
corrupting effect is amplified by the fact that legal
toleration of these contests, even and perhaps especially if
accompanied
by government regulations, would seem to send a tacit message of
official
approval of violence and cruelty. Moreover, the probable effects on
impressionable
children, who (even if they are barred from witnessing the contests
"live")
are likely to idolize successful gladiators, are even more alarming.
Consequently,
the harm principle itself, which any liberal can embrace without fear
of
unjust intrusions on individual autonomy, is sufficient to justify
banning
Kristol's hypothetical practice of modern gladiatorial contests.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[48]&nbsp;
Although Feinberg's arguments do not refute legal moralism--they
show only that a liberal can give a plausible analysis of hard cases
without
using this principle--I will not use it as an independent reason for
restricting
boxing. While strict legal moralism is intuitively attractive in the
case
of boxing, we might have difficulty avoiding sliding down a slippery
slope
to interferences with harmless self-regarding behavior for trivial
reasons,
and to the same danger of the legal enforcement of groundless
prejudices
that is created by moral conservatism. If strict legal moralism is not
necessary to explain why we should ban gladiatorial contests, we are
even
less justified in using this controversial principle in arguing for
restricting
the far less dangerous business of boxing. In the next section, I will
consider instead whether we can formulate arguments for restricting
boxing
based on the harm principle similar to the ones that Feinberg uses to
argue
for prohibiting gladiatorial contests.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">3. Arguments Based
on Harm to Society at Large
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[49]&nbsp; Boxing
is considerably less violent than gladiatorial contests,
primarily in that the death of the loser is only an occasional tragedy,
rather than the inevitable result of each bout. Any brutalizing effect
of boxing, then, will be considerably less severe than that of
gladiatorial
contests. Nonetheless, as pointed out above in our discussion of legal
moralism, the morally troubling feature is the same in both cases: the
infliction of pain and injury for the pleasure of onlookers. And it is
precisely the message that it is acceptable to take pleasure in
watching
the suffering of others that creates a very real danger that it will
increase
anti-social behavior. And, unlike Kristol's hypothetical gladiators,
boxers
are real people who are idolized by real children, who learn that
hurting
and injuring opponents is an admirable thing to do. The number of
people
present at fights may be relatively small, but the television audience,
including pay-perview, closed circuit, and sports bars, is huge.
Moreover,
the mere knowledge that public displays of the attempts of fighters to
incapacitate one another are legally tolerated may lower the inhibition
to anti-social behavior of even those with no interest in boxing.
Unlike
boxers, the public at large does not consent to the practice and any
harm
that it may cause, so an uncontroversial application of the harm
principle
may justify restricting boxing in order to protect society as a whole.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[50]&nbsp;
However, this argument invites the objection that concern
for freedom of expression has quite properly prevented us from banning
violent films despite comparable fears that viewing them causes an
increase
in violent behavior. The same concern should also prevent us from
restricting
boxing. In response, a huge distinction exists between the depiction of
violence, which is all that happens in films, and violence itself,
which
is what happens in the boxing ring. Restricting actions is less
problematic
than restricting the portrayal of actions in movies. A more apt analogy
would be between boxing and either "snuff" films in which actors are
allegedly
injured or killed, or pornographic films in which unwilling actors are
allegedly coerced to appear, both of which we would have less
hesitation
in restricting than mainstream films.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[51]&nbsp; Robert
Simon raises a related objection, asking whether the
same reasoning that led to restricting boxing wouldn't also commit us
to
banning books that we have determined will have a pernicious effect,
for
instance, one that proposes educational reforms that would be
disastrous
if implemented, which is likely, given the prestige of its author.
Simon
claims that such restrictions would seriously impede our ability to
make
up our own minds on educational and other issues.(43) In response to
Simon's
reductio ad absurdum, while the alleged consequence that he describes
is
indeed unacceptable, it does not follow from the argument for
restricting
boxing that we are considering. The reason that his example of book
banning
is alarming is that it involves the outright censorship of ideas, which
undeniably does interfere with our ability to exercise intellectual
autonomy
in reaching our own views. In contrast, restricting boxing in no way
precludes
the publication of books describing the alleged beauty of the activity,
explaining its physical and emotional benefits, and demanding its
legalization.
Prohibiting boxing restricts people's actions, not their access to
ideas.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[52]&nbsp; The
weakness of the argument for restricting boxing on the
ground of its brutalizing effect on society is not that it entails
indefensible
instances of censorship. Nor is there any problem in principle with
restricting
behavior that fosters attitudes that lead to tangible harm to other
people.
The Achilles Heel of this argument is the lack of evidence that boxing
actually leads to an increase in violence and other anti-social
behavior.
Whether boxing incites such behavior or reduces it by acting as a
harmless
cathartic outlet is an empirical question that is hard to answer. In
particular,
finding a pure control group so that we can isolate the influence of
boxing
on, for instance, violence is especially difficult. Comparisons between
states and countries that do allow professional boxing and those that
do
not are of limited value, since television coverage is ubiquitous
worldwide.
The best evidence would come from a comparison of the level of violent
and anti-social behavior in an experimental group that watches many
boxing
matches and a carefully matched control group that watches none. In the
absence of such evidence, the argument for restricting boxing because
of
the danger that it harms society by lowering inhibitions to anti-social
behavior is too slight to justify restricting people's freedom.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">4. Conclusion
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[53]&nbsp; We have
found two substantial paternalistic arguments for
restricting professional boxing: first, the need to protect boxers from
serious losses of future autonomy due to irreversible brain damage,
which
is all the more urgent because, second, many boxers' decisions to enter
the profession in the first place are of questionable autonomy because
of de facto coercion resulting from their socioeconomic disadvantages.
While legal moralism does not by itself provide a defensible rationale
for restricting boxing, the argument presented in section 2 that boxers
and fans have inherently immoral attitudes bolsters the paternalistic
argument.
That is, if strong reasons exist for protecting boxers from harm, then
if, furthermore, far from having redeeming value, boxing is inherently
immoral, the case for restricting it is stronger still.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[54]&nbsp; I
propose a single legal restriction--a complete ban on blows
to the head--which would allow boxing to continue, while eliminating
its
single most harmful aspect.(44) Injuries could still occur, of course,
as a result of body blows, but they would not have the devastating
effect
on boxers' well-being and future autonomy that brain damage has. Given
this vast reduction in the risks of boxing, we could require potential
boxers to demonstrate a considerably more relaxed standard of autonomy,
one that even the most socioeconomically disadvantaged people would
probably
meet. Imposing this restriction would thus neutralize the two
paternalistic
arguments for prohibiting boxing.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[55]&nbsp;
Granted, boxing would remain a violent activity the goal
of which is to incapacitate the opponent, so the argument for
restricting
boxing because of the inherently immoral attitude that boxers adopt
toward
one another would remain operative. However, as I argued at the end of
section 2, legal moralism is not by itself a sufficient reason for
restricting
boxing. Moreover, the attitude of boxers and spectators is likely to be
less troubling under the proposed reform. Knockouts and stoppages arise
far more commonly as a result of blows to the head than from body
blows.
The likely result of restricting boxers to body blows is to reorient
their
strategy in favor of scoring points with frequent blows, rather than
trying
to injure opponents with heavy shots. Thus the role of skill and
strategy
will be increased, with a corresponding decrease in violence and
intimidation.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[56]&nbsp; Market
forces may give rise to fighters who will meet fans'
demand for violence by specializing in punches that crack ribs and
cause
other painful injuries. However, the many fans who are currently drawn
to boxing by the prospect of seeing bloody fighters become groggy and
drop
to the canvas after repeated blows to the head would most likely lose
interest
if boxing became a relatively safe sport in which knockouts are rare
and
skill and strategy, rather than the infliction of injuries, are the
major
determinants of victory. And boxing purists who continue to like, and
even
prefer, this safer form of boxing would probably be too rare for
professional
boxing to continue to be a profitable business. The likely result of
eliminating
blows to the head, then, is the withering away of professional boxing,
which depends on attracting large numbers of spectators to pay fighters
and their handlers.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[57]&nbsp; This
would leave amateur boxing, which is already--with its
short three-round bouts, mandatory protective headgear, and referees'
greater
willingness to stop fights to prevent injuries to outmatched
fighters--considerably
safer than professional fighting.45 It would become even safer with a
prohibition
on blows to the head, which would make protective headgear superfluous.
Amateur boxing would continue as a recreation for boxers who enjoy the
sport, but the number of participants would probably dramatically
decline,
since many boxers currently use the amateur arena as a prelude to the
professional
business that would, under my proposal, most likely soon cease to
exist.
The elimination of financial motives for entering the ring would
completely
disarm one of my major objections to today's professional boxing,
namely
the danger that socioeconomically disadvantaged boxers might be acting
inautonomously due to de facto coercion. And pre-emptive paternalism
would
be out of the question, since no significant danger of irreversible
brain
damage would exist.
</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">[58]&nbsp; A
salutary aspect of my proposal is that it achieves its
carefully targeted goal of eliminating the morally objectionable
components
of boxing while imposing minimal legal restrictions on the actions of
competent
adults. The single regulation, a ban on blows to the head in any type
of
boxing, is justified by the uncontroversial goal of protecting boxers
from
acting on inautonomous decisions and suffering a permanent reduction in
future autonomy. And the likely disappearance of professional boxing
would
be the result of market forces rather than governmental coercion, as
would
the likely reduction in the number of participants in amateur
boxing.(46)

</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">(5) RESOLVED, That
the American Medical Association: 1. Encourage the
elimination of both amateur and professional boxing, a sport in which
the
primary objective is to inflict injury; 2. Communicate its opposition
to
boxing as a sport to appropriate regulatory bodies; 3. Assist state
medical
societies to work with their state legislatures to enact laws to
eliminate
boxing in their jurisdictions; and 4. Educate the American public,
especially
children and young adults, about the dangerous effects of boxing on the
health of participants.

</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">(8) Thus, while
the AMA's proposal to ban boxing is obviously contrary
to the liberal position, its call to educate the public, especially
children

consistent
with liberalism.

</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><font size="-1">(12) Following
Feinberg (ibid., p. 211), I base both the coercive minimum
and the differential coercive pressure on boxers' subjective assessment
of the harms of boxing and of the poverty that it enables them to
escape.
As I explain in the next paragraph, boxers' assessments of these harms
may vary.

is thus similar to George D. Lundberg's disjunctive
proposal to either ban boxing outright or ban blows to the head. See
"Boxing
Should Be Banned in Civilized Countries," Journal of the American
Medical
Association vol. 251, no. 20 (May 25, 1984), p. 2697. Robert L. Simon
also
proposes banning blows to the head as one of several ways of improving
safety in boxing. See Fair Play, p. 64. I differ from Simon in that,
whereas
he suggests only that the ban be enacted voluntarily by boxing
authorities,
I claim that the arguments presented in this paper are strong enough to
justify a government-enacted legal prohibition.
