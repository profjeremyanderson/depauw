            <span class="date">November 24 - 30, 2004</span>
            <p class="bodytext" align="justify">In April 9, 2003, the
day the statue of Saddam Hussein was being toppled in Baghdad,
symbolizing the promised liberation of Iraq, I was embedded with a
Marine unit engaged in fierce combat about 30 miles north of the city,
on the outskirts of Baquba. Late that afternoon, the Humvee I was in
was following about 50 feet behind a Marine Light Armored Vehicle when
it pulled alongside a Toyota pickup pushed to the side of the road, its
doors riddled with bullet holes. The head of at least one occupant was
visible in the truck, but I couldn't determine if he was moving or not.
Nor did I see any weapons. As our Humvee stopped behind the truck, a
Marine in the vehicle ahead of us leapt out, pointed his rifle into the
window of the pickup and sprayed it with gunfire. It was a cold-blooded
execution. </p>
            <p class="bodytext" align="justify">As we continued
forward, passing the truck, I glimpsed at least two corpses sprawled on
the seats, the interior spattered with blood. During the brief moment I
looked, I was unable to determine whether the dead men possessed
weapons. None of the four Marines in our Humvee said anything. We had
been awake for more than 30 hours, much of that time under steady
mortar, rifle, machine-gun, and rocket-propelled grenade fire from
enemy combatants who dressed in civilian clothes and moved around on
the battlefield in Toyota pickups. (To make matters even more
confusing, during the height of combat farmers were racing into the
surrounding fields&#8212;where enemy soldiers were shooting at us from
dug-in, concealed positions&#8212;in order to rescue sheep from the gunfire.)
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext" align="justify">In the previous few
minutes we had already passed more than a dozen corpses strewn by the
side of the road. Some had the tops of their heads missing, expertly
hit by Marine riflemen. Others were burned&#8212;still smoking,
actually&#8212;having crawled out of other vehicles set ablaze by rockets
fired from Marine helicopters. The execution of one or two more men
wasn't worth commenting on.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext" align="justify">I greeted the sight of
dead Iraqis in the pickup with a sense of numb relief. At least they
would not be trying to kill us that day. In the preceding
two-and-a-half weeks, the unit I was embedded with had come under
frequent enemy attack, with three Marines wounded. There were 23 bullet
holes in the Humvee I rode in&#8212;miraculously, none of the five of us
inside had been hit. I had developed a strange relationship with the
sight of dead Iraqis. I felt safer when I saw them.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext" align="justify">I felt especially
comforted when I saw dead men by the road still clutching weapons in
their hands, a common sight. Unfortunately, of the hundreds of dead
people I saw on the roads leading from the Kuwait border to Baghdad,
perhaps 20 percent or more were obviously civilians. I will never
forget the three or four women I saw fatally shot and partially burned,
still seated in a bus on the road north of Nasiriyah. Or the little
girl, about four, lying by the side of the road in a pretty dress, her
legs neatly and inexplicably chopped off at the knees. Mercifully, I
remember thinking at the time, she was dead like all the others.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext" align="justify">Since my return from
Iraq, I have continued to watch the horror unfold on television. It's
different seeing the violence decontextualized from the battlefield,
now playing out in discrete video clips that run between ads for Chevys
and the Olive Garden. Videos of militants staging beheadings against
dungeon-like backdrops, with the perpetrators wearing masks and the
victims in colorful jumpsuits, seem almost like grotesque TV shows.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext" align="justify">One of the great
ironies of the Bush administration, obsessed as it is with Christian
values and the attendant crusade to punish what it deems obscene and
lewd in the media (from Janet Jackson's breast to Howard Stern's
speech), is that it has given us a war in which the airing of snuff
films on national TV has become routine. The conflict in Iraq, as seen
through news coverage, has begun to resemble the macabre underground
1980s video series <i>Faces of Death</i>. Throw in the images produced
by the U.S. Army at Abu Ghraib, and the administration has put itself
in the running to successfully compete with the BDSM side of the porn
industry.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext" align="justify">Just as I thought I was
adjusting to the video carnage, NBC correspondent Kevin Sites, embedded
with U.S. forces in Falluja, gave us last week's shocker: the video of
a Marine standing over a wounded, apparently unarmed Arab sprawled on
the floor of a mosque and executing him with a gunshot to the head.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext" align="justify">It brought back
memories of the April 9 episode and others I witnessed in Iraq. Yet,
watching this on TV, I felt the same outrage many others have
expressed. American soldiers, we like to believe, don't shoot unarmed
people. Not only is this morally repugnant, but execution of wounded,
unarmed combatants violates Article Three of the Geneva Convention
Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, which states in part
that "persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including
members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed
hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause,
shall in all circumstances be treated humanely."
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext" align="justify">Even to those
unfamiliar with the Geneva Conventions, it seems obvious from the
mosque video that a war crime was committed. The response from the
administration and military officials has been unusually swift.
Ambassador to Iraq John Negroponte conveyed his regrets to Prime
Minister Ayad Allawi and vowed that "the individual in question will be
dealt with." The Marine in the video, whose name has been withheld, was
pulled from duty, and his commanders issued a statement promising to
investigate what they called "an allegation of the unlawful use of
force in the death of an enemy combatant." Lieutenant General John F.
Sattler, commander of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force in Iraq, added
in an interview, "We follow the law of armed conflict and hold
ourselves to a high standard of accountability."
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext" align="justify">One thing military
officials are not saying is that the behavior of the Marine in the
video closely conforms to training that is fairly standard in some
units. Marines call executing wounded combatants "dead-checking."
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext" align="justify">"They teach us to do
dead-checking when we're clearing rooms," an enlisted Marine recently
returned from Iraq told me. "You put two bullets into the guy's chest
and one in the brain. But when you enter a room where guys are wounded
you might not know if they're alive or dead. So they teach us to
dead-check them by pressing them in the eye with your boot, because
generally a person, even if he's faking being dead, will flinch if you
poke him there. If he moves, you put a bullet in the brain. You do this
to keep the momentum going when you're flowing through a building. You
don't want a guy popping up behind you and shooting you."
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext" align="justify">What I'd seen on that
road outside of Baquba on April 9 was a dead-check. The Marine who
fired into that Toyota with wounded men inside didn't want anybody
shooting at us as we went past. It may have been a war crime, and had I
possessed a video camera at the time and filmed it, the Marine who
fired into the truck might have faced punishment. As it was, no one
questioned the Marine's actions.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext" align="justify">In fact, commanders in
the Marine Corps during the period I was embedded with them in the
spring of 2003 repeatedly emphasized that the men's actions would not
be questioned. As one of the officers in the unit I followed used to
tell his men, "You will be held accountable for the facts not as they
are in hindsight but as they appeared to you at the time. If, in your
mind, you fire to protect yourself or your men, you are doing the right
thing. It doesn't matter if later on we find out you wiped out a family
of unarmed civilians."
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext" align="justify">Commanders didn't want
their men to suffer casualties because they were overly constrained by
rules of engagement. At the same time, Marines were constantly drilled
in refraining from shooting their weapons, even at certain times when
they came under fire. On one afternoon I recall in particular, the unit
I was with was ordered to hold a position on the outskirts of a hostile
town. For six hours, insurgents fired at the Marines from rooftops and
from behind piles of rubble they'd set up in streets as barricades. But
the Marines I was with, unable to pinpoint the exact locations of the
enemy shooters, refused to fire back for fear of hitting civilians. The
22-year-old radio operator of the team I was with had it within his
power to call in an artillery strike on the corner of the town where
most of the enemy forces seemed concentrated. At one point, while I was
crouched in the dirt, taking cover behind the tire of the Humvee as
enemy sniper rounds popped into the dust nearby, I asked him why he
didn't call in a strike. He simply laughed at my display of fear.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext" align="justify">There were other times
when the enlisted men in the unit fell into violent quarrels with
others whom they felt were too aggressive and risked civilian lives. In
one instance, enlisted men nearly came to blows with an officer whom
they accused of firing a weapon into a house that they believed
contained civilians. Despite their concern, terrible mistakes were
made. I was standing next to a 22-year-old Marine from the Humvee I
rode in when he fired his machine gun prematurely at a civilian car
approaching a roadblock, striking the driver, an unarmed man, in the
eye. The unit was subsequently ordered to drive past the car without
rendering aid. I sat next to the gunner as we crept past, listening to
the dying man gasp for breath. The gunner didn't talk for the next
three days. A few days earlier, the youngest Marine on the team had
shot a 12-year-old boy four times in the chest with his machine gun,
mistakenly thinking a stick the boy had been carrying was a weapon.
When the mother and grandmother of the boy later dragged him to the
Marines' lines seeking medical aid, the sergeant who led the team
dropped down in front of the mother and cried.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext" align="justify">The Marines constantly
debated the morality of what they were engaged in. A sergeant in the
platoon told me he had consulted with his priest about killing. The
priest had told him it was all right to kill for his government so long
as he didn't enjoy it. By the time the unit reached the outskirts of
Baghdad, this sergeant was certain he had already killed at least four
men. When his battalion commander praised the unit for "slaying
dragons" on the way to Baghdad, the sergeant later told his men, "If we
did half the shit back home we've done here, we'd be in prison." By
then, the sergeant told me, he'd reconsidered what his priest had told
him about killing. "Where the fuck did Jesus say it's OK to kill people
for your government? Any priest who tells me that has got no
credibility."
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext" align="justify">He and several other
Marines recently returned from Iraq (many from their second tours) whom
I've talked to about the Falluja shooting say they are not sure they
would have dead-checked the wounded man in the mosque had they been in
the same position. Most say they probably would have, even though the
mosque had already been cleared once. "What does the American public
think happens when they tell us to assault a city?" one of them said.
"Marines don't shoot rainbows out of our asses. We fucking kill
people."
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext" align="justify">Another Marine in the
unit I followed&#8212;a Democrat's dream, he returned home from fighting in
Falluja in time to vote for Kerry&#8212;added, "Americans celebrate war in
their movies. We like to see visions of evil being defeated by good.
When the people at home glimpse the reality of war, that it's a
bloodbath, they freak out. We are a subculture they created and
programmed to fight their wars. You have to become a psycho to kill
like we do. To most Marines that guy in the mosque was just someone who
didn't get hit in the right place the first time we shot him. I
probably would have put a bullet in his brain if I'd been there. If the
American public doesn't like the violence of war, maybe before they
start the next war they shouldn't rush so much." </p>
