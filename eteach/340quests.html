                demonstrate that you understand and have thought about
                that material.&#8221; So your essays should demonstrate that

                close attention in class, thought about it all
                carefully. Per the syllabus, the exam is worth 10% of

                available. Whenever you give an opinion, provide reasons

                persuasive. That is, try to show not why you think as

                    style="font-style: italic;">Crito</span>, Socrates
                  says that &#8220;you must either persuade [your government]
                  or else do whatever it commands; that you must mind
                  your behavior and undergo whatever treatment it
                  prescribes for you, whether a beating or imprisonment;
                  that if it leads you to war to be wounded or killed,
                  that&#8217;s what you must do, and that&#8217;s what is just&#8221;
                  (Plato, 69; at 51b). First explain, in as much detail
                  as you can, Socrates&#8217; argument in the Crito for this
                  claim. Second, to what extent to you agree with
                  Socrates here--partially, fully, not at all? Give the
                  best reasons you can for why reasonable people should
                  agree with your appraisal. <br>

                  </span>Thrasymachus defends the view that injustice is
                  better than justice (Plato, 82-6; 338b-344c),
                  concluding with the claim that "injustice if it is on
                  a large enough scale, is stronger, freer, and more
                  masterful than justice" (Plato, 86; at 344c). Socrates
                  responds with several rebuttals (Plato, 86-93;
                  344d-354a), to which Thrasymachus eventually feels
                  forced to agree by the end of <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">Republic </span>Book I.
                  But how good are Socrates' rebuttals, really? There
                  are too many to discuss all of them, so pick one and,
                  first, explain it in as much detail as you can,
                  including how it is supposed to rebut what
                  Thrasymachus said. Then, critically evaluate Socrates'
                  argument, giving the best reasons you can for why
                  reasonable people should agree with your appraisal.<br>

                  Book III of <span style="font-style: italic;">Republic</span>,
                  Socrates explains his &#8220;noble lie&#8221; (Plato, 128-9; at
                  414c &#8211; 416b). First explain, in as much detail as you
                  can, the lie and how it is intended to support the
                  ideal city. Then explain why this sort of practice
                  should be approved, or not, showing why reasonable
                  people should agree with you. Resist the temptation to
                  think this is easy. You might perhaps consider similar
                  practices in your own upbringing, such as how you were
                  taught to be patriotic; you should consider the goals
                  of the lie and whether they are worthy, and how they
                  might be attained. <br>

                    person must practice one of the pursuits in the
                    city, the one for which he is naturally best suited&#8221;
                    and goes on to say this is among the things that
                    &#8220;will most contribute to making our city good&#8221;
                    (Plato, 139; at 433a, 433d). On the other hand, when
                    people try to perform tasks they are not naturally
                    suited for, he says &#8220;these exchanges and meddling
                    destroy the city&#8221; (Plato 140; at 434b). First&nbsp;
                    explain, in as much detail as you can, the
                    arrangement that Socrates has in mind here (the
                    three-class system of the city, and the requisite
                    virtues). Then, critically evaluate this
                    arrangement. There are any number of ways you might
                    do that well; one would be to consider some strong
                    objection to it and argue for how well (or not)
                    Socrates' arrangement can withstand it. (You might
                    use any of the objections we discussed in
                    class--which themselves came from reading responses
                    for our February 14 class; because of time
                    constraints I suggest only considering one
                    objection, or at most two.)</span></font><br>
