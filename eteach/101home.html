            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">The main focus of this
              course is understanding and evaluating the assigned texts.
              They show us important and influential philosophical
              ideas.<br>
              <br>
              Using these texts, I want to acquaint you with
              philosophy&#8217;s content and techniques, and sharpen your
              writing and thinking. Through reading, lecture,
              discussion, and&nbsp; writing you&#8217;ll get to know
              philosophy&#8217;s major divisions, including epistemology,
              metaphysics, and ethics, and some of the puzzles that
              philosophers think about. Does God exist? Is the outside
              world as it appears to be? Are we free? How should we lead
              our lives? You will learn about and evaluate major
              thinkers' answers to questions like these. You will
              enhance your critical thinking skills so that your beliefs
              can be better grounded in logic, deepened by an
              understanding of the issues at stake, and tempered with an
              appreciation of opposing views. In writing, you will
              practice expressing new and complex ideas. These critical
              reading, thinking, and writing skills are useful in every
              discipline and many walks of life. <br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Student outcomes</span><br>
              <br>
              To put the above another way, students will be able to:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>State some central philosophical questions and
                  describe some of the main answers to those questions
                  that have been proposed.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Analyze philosophical arguments, identifying
                  important strengths and weaknesses in those arguments.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Develop their own views on important philosophical
                  questions and defend those views in both speech and
                  writing.</li>
                <li>Demonstrate your grasp of the above in reading
                  responses, papers, exams, and discussion, at a level
                  appropriate for a 100-level course. </li>

              readings, lectures, presentations, and discussion. If and
              when any independent research is required, your grade will
              also depend on the quality of that research and on
              demonstrating you understand and have thought carefully
              about the material. Grades will be derived as follows:<br>

                Earning one point per week, by whatever means, will earn

                Each assignment includes some reading questions. Asking
                you to write answers to all of them would be too

                    response. If it's not at least 200 words, try
                    answering another question until you've got at least
                    200 words total. But no matter how many of that

                    need. All you need to do is turn in one per week
                    and, in some weeks, turn in more than one, and see
                    to it you total 15 passing responses by the last

                and a final. Each will be comprehensive, covering all
                material previously discussed in the course. You may not
                access texts or notes during in-class exams. Exams
                account for 55% of the course grade, so you should
                prepare for them. To help you succeed on exams, I offer

                    so on.</li>

                    <li>Citations and links in the study guide direct

                texts and notes (and classmates--group study is often
                helpful) to remind yourself of the relevant material,
                write out the best answers you can, and study them

                usually worse than turning in no work at all, and
                penalties can include failing the course, suspension, or
                expulsion. Much cheating is due to ignorance of the

              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">To enable class
                interaction, class will be taught synchronously if
                possible, meeting via video conference during the hours
                in the schedule of classes. This means virtually
                visiting people's living spaces. Class meetings will be
                recorded to serve as a learning resource for the class.
                To respect your classmates, me, and those you live with:<br>
                <ul>
                  <li> Do not share those recordings or any portion of
                    them outside the class. </li>
                  <li> Keep your camera on. (If this won't work for you,
                    please talk with me about it.)</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li> There are advantages to having cameras on.
                      Having faces visible enables lip-reading and
                      interpreting facial expressions, which help us
                      better understand each other. <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>You can prevent others from seeing your living
                      space by using a background image or blurred
                      background.</li>
                    <li>Mind what your camera shows to others. For
                      example, liquor bottles visible in an underage
                      student's dorm room could be a problem. So could
                      racist or otherwise offensive posters or
                      paraphernalia in the background. Let's avoid that.

              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Reading is an act of
                contemplation, perhaps the only act in which we allow
                ourselves to merge with the consciousness of another
                human being. We possess the books we read, animating the
                waiting stillness of their language, but they possess us
                also, filling us with thoughts and observations, asking
                us to make them part of ourselves.... In order for this
                to work, however, we need a certain type of silence, an
                ability to filter out the noise.<br>

              Make time, in a quiet space, to read. Not just once, not
              quickly like it&#8217;s a news article, but deeply. Turn off
              your TV, phone, radio, MP3. When reading online, close all
              other windows, set Skype to offline, turn off chats, and
              release yourself from Facebook etc. Philosophical texts
              reward focused, careful, and repeated reading. Besides,
              you can expect me to call on you with questions about it.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading assignments for this
              course typically consist of a selection written by a
              philosopher and some introductory material written by the
              book&#8217;s editor, Andrew Bailey. Bailey suggests you read the
              selection first, and then go back and read the
              introductory material, and then read the selection again
              (Bailey, xi). I recommend following this advice. (A few
              exceptions are noted on the Reading Assignments page.)<br>

              copying what&#8217;s on the board or screen (or whatever I'm
              doing in class) may not be enough. If the notes you take
              during class are sketchy, take a moment after class to
              fill them out.<br>
              <br>

              allow yourself to stay confused or lost. Some students
              assume their questions aren't worth asking or their
              comments not worth making, but often others wanted to say
              the same thing. If you are not comfortable speaking in
              class, see me outside it.<br>

              <span style="font-weight: bold;">If you miss class, </span>make


































              arrangements with others to share notes with you. I
              suggest agreeing with at least two other people in the
              class, at the beginning of the semester, to share notes.
              If class is taught remotely, watch the recordings. <br>

              and write out the clearest, most complete and thoughtful
              answers you can. If you have trouble formulating answers,
