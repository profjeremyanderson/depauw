            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">The main focus of this
              course is understanding and evaluating the assigned texts.
              They show us important and influential philosophical
              ideas.<br>
              <br>
              Using these texts, I want to acquaint you with
              philosophy&#8217;s content and techniques, and sharpen your
              writing and thinking. Through reading, lecture,
              discussion, and&nbsp; writing you&#8217;ll get to know
              philosophy&#8217;s major divisions, including epistemology,
              metaphysics, and ethics, and some of the puzzles that
              philosophers think about. Does God exist? Is the outside
              world as it appears to be? Are we free? How should we lead
              our lives? You will learn about and evaluate major
              thinkers' answers to questions like these. You will
              enhance your critical thinking skills so that your beliefs
              can be better grounded in logic, deepened by an
              understanding of the issues at stake, and tempered with an
              appreciation of opposing views. In writing, you will
              practice expressing new and complex ideas. These critical
              thinking and writing skills are useful in every
              discipline. <br>

              <br>
              To put the above another way, students will be able to:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>Understand and summarize a range of philosophical
                  texts in metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.</li>
                <li>Identify philosophers' answers to questions such as
                  "Does God exist?" "Is the world as it appears?" "Are
                  we free?" and "How should we live?"</li>
                <li>Explain, using basic logic concepts, how
                  philosophers argue for their answers to these
                  questions. </li>
                <li>Critically evaluate the arguments philosophers and
                  others (e.g., me, other students) give. </li>
                <li>Demonstrate your grasp of the above in reading
                  responses, papers, exams, and discussion, at a level
                  appropriate for a 100-level course. </li>
              </ul>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">As you might expect, your
              grade will depend on how well you demonstrate you
              understand, and have thought about, material brought up in
              readings, lectures, presentations, and discussion. If and
              when any independent research is required, your grade will
              also depend on the quality of that research and on
              demonstrating you understand and have thought carefully
              about the material. Grades will be derived as follows:<br>

                Each assignment includes some reading questions. Asking

                        Academic Integrity Policy</a>. (<a
                        href="#integrity">Here's more about academic

                  To earn a B (85%), do one passing reading response per
                  week (a total of 11). To earn an A+ (100%), do at
                  least one response each week (passing or not), with a
                  total of 13 passing responses during the semester.<br>
                  <br>
                  If you find these instructions confusing, my
                  apologies! Let me try explaining a different way:<br>
                  <br>
                  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">First, <span
                      style="font-style: italic;">to do one passing
                      reading response</span>, try answering one reading
                    question. If your answer is at least 200 words and
                    it meets the other criteria in the assignment (on
                    time, answers the question thoughtfully, meets the
                    requirements for <a href="101papers.html#integrity">integrity</a>
                    and proofreading) it gets credit for one reading
                    response. If it's not at least 200 words, try
                    answering another question until you've got at least
                    200 words total. But no matter how many of that
                    assignment's questions you answer, it's still just
                    one reading response.<br>
                    <br>
                    Second, <span style="font-style: italic;">to get an
                      A+ for the assignment</span>, you need 13 passing
                    responses. There are 14 weeks of class. So, doing
                    more than one passing response every week would be
                    more than you need. All you need to do is turn in
                    one per week and, in some weeks, turn in more than
                    one, and see to it you total 13 passing responses by
                    the last week of class.<br>

                  you take too long Moodle can log you out, which could
                  wipe out your work. So try typing your response using
                  a word processor first, then copy and paste your
                  response into the forum before the deadline.<br>

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Papers: </span>In your
                papers you will critically evaluate arguments discussed
                in the class. They will allow you to practice, and
                improve at, expressing challenging ideas clearly and
                accurately and appraising them fairly. Assignments will
                be posted to the Papers web page as the time approaches,
                and we will take class time to discuss assignments and
                help you improve your writing before turning in final
                drafts.<br>

              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">There will be two midterms
                and a final. Each will be comprehensive, covering all
                material previously discussed in the course. You may not
                access texts or notes during in-class exams. Exams
                account for 55% of the course grade, so you should
                prepare for them. To help you succeed on exams, I offer
                several resources besides lecture and discussion:<br>
                <ul>
                  <li>The <a href="101studyguide.html">study guide</a>
                    identifies what you may be tested on: terms we
                    learn, people we study, the arguments they give, and
                    so on.</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Citations and links in the study guide direct
                      you to material needed for giving good answers.</li>
                    <li>The study guide also explains <a
                        href="101studyguide.html#expectations">my
                        expectations</a>: how you should be able to
                      respond to terms, what to know about the people we
                      study, etc. There are some sample answers there,
                      too.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>There will be review sessions before every exam.

                The best way to prepare: keep up each week. I will add
                new items to the study guide roughly each week and
                notify you via email. When new items are added, use the
                texts and notes (and classmates--group study is often
                helpful) to remind yourself of the relevant material,
                write out the best answers you can, and study them
                periodically.<br>

                Otherwise, there is no guarantee they can be provided

              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">To enable class
                interaction, class will be taught synchronously if
                possible, meeting via video conference during the hours
                in the schedule of classes. This means virtually
                visiting people's living spaces. Class meetings will be
                recorded to serve as a learning resource for the class.
                To respect your classmates, me, and those you live with:<br>
                <ul>
                  <li> Do not share those recordings or any portion of
                    them outside the class. </li>
                  <li> Keep your camera on. (If this won't work for you,
                    please talk with me about it.)</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li> There are advantages to having cameras on.
                      Having faces visible enables lip-reading and
                      interpreting facial expressions, which help us
                      better understand each other. <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>You can prevent others from seeing your living
                      space by using a background image or blurred
                      background.</li>
                    <li>Mind what your camera shows to others. For
                      example, liquor bottles visible in an underage
                      student's dorm room could be a problem. So could
                      racist or otherwise offensive posters or
                      paraphernalia in the background. Let's avoid that.

              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Reading is an act of
                contemplation, perhaps the only act in which we allow
                ourselves to merge with the consciousness of another
                human being. We possess the books we read, animating the
                waiting stillness of their language, but they possess us
                also, filling us with thoughts and observations, asking
                us to make them part of ourselves.... In order for this
                to work, however, we need a certain type of silence, an
                ability to filter out the noise.<br>

              Make time, in a quiet space, to read. Not just once, not
              quickly like it&#8217;s a news article, but deeply. Turn off
              your TV, phone, radio, MP3. When reading online, close all
              other windows, set Skype to offline, turn off chats, and
              release yourself from Facebook etc. Philosophical texts
              reward focused, careful, and repeated reading. Besides,
              you can expect me to call on you with questions about it.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading assignments for this
              course typically consist of a selection written by a
              philosopher and some introductory material written by the
              book&#8217;s editor, Andrew Bailey. Bailey suggests you read the
              selection first, and then go back and read the
              introductory material, and then read the selection again
              (Bailey, xi). I recommend following this advice. (A few
              exceptions are noted on the Reading Assignments page.)<br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Come to class prepared. </span>Bring






              the current reading and your notes with you. Bring your
              responses to the current reading questions with you.<br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Take detailed notes. </span>Just






              copying what&#8217;s on the board or screen (or whatever I'm
              doing in class) may not be enough. If the notes you take
              during class are sketchy, take a moment after class to
              fill them out.<br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Participate a lot. </span>Don&#8217;t






              allow yourself to stay confused or lost. Some students
              assume their questions aren't worth asking or their
              comments not worth making, but often others wanted to say
              the same thing. If you are not comfortable speaking in
              class, see me outside it.<br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">If you miss class, </span>make






              arrangements with others to share notes with you. I
              suggest agreeing with at least two other people in the
              class, at the beginning of the semester, to share notes.
              If class is taught remotely, watch the recordings. <br>

              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Keep up with the study

              classmates (if you like--studying in groups is helpful)
              and write out the clearest, most complete and thoughtful
              answers you can. If you have trouble formulating answers,
              come see me for help. Study your answers regularly to
              prepare for class discussion and for exams. This will pay
              off.<br>
