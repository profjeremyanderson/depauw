      <p>Cameraman tells Falluja marines why he broadcast controversial

    </font><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">The broadcast
      last week of footage showing a US marine shooting an injured Iraqi
      fighter in Falluja caused an international outcry. Yesterday the
      cameraman, Kevin Sites, published on his website this open letter
      to the marines with whom he had been embedded.</font>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"

        <p>Since the shooting in the mosque, I've been haunted that I
          have not been able to tell you directly what I saw or explain
          the process by which the world came to see it as well.</p>
        <p>As you know, I'm not some war zone tourist with a camera who
          doesn't understand that ugly things happen in combat. I've
          spent most of the last five years covering global conflict.
          But I have never in my career been a "gotcha" reporter -
          hoping for people to commit wrongdoings so I can catch them at
          it.</p>
        <p>This week I've been shocked to see myself painted as some
          kind of anti-war activist. Anyone who has seen my reporting on
          television or has read my dispatches on the web is fully aware
          of the lengths I've gone to to play it straight down the
          middle - not to become a tool of propaganda for the left or
          the right. But I find myself a lightning rod for controversy
          in reporting what I saw occur in front of me, camera rolling.</p>
        <p>It's time for you to have the facts, in my own words, about
          what I saw, without imposing on that marine guilt or innocence
          or anything in between. I want you to read my account and make
          up your own minds. Here it goes.</p>
        <p>It's Saturday morning and we're still at our strong point
          from the night before, a clearing between a set of buildings
          on the southern edge of the city. The advance has been swift,
          but pockets of resistance still exist. In fact, we're taking
          sniper fire from both the front and the rear.</p>
        <p>Weapons Company uses its 81's (mortars) where they spot
          muzzle flashes. The tanks do some blasting of their own. By
          mid-morning, we're told we're moving north again. We'll be
          back clearing some of the area we passed yesterday. There are
          also reports that the mosque, where 10 insurgents were killed
          and five wounded on Friday, may have been re-occupied
          overnight.</p>
        <p>I decide to leave you guys and pick up with one of the
          infantry squads as they move house-to-house back toward the
          mosque. Many of the structures are empty of people - but full
          of weapons. Outside one residence, a member of the squad lobs
          a frag grenade over the wall. Everyone piles in, including me.</p>
        <p>While the marines go into the house, I follow the flames
          caused by the grenade into the courtyard. When the smoke
          clears, I can see through my viewfinder that the fire is
          burning beside a large pile of anti-aircraft rounds.</p>
        <p>I yell to the lieutenant that we need to move. Almost
          immediately after clearing out of the house, small explosions
          begin as the rounds cook off in the fire.</p>
        <p>At that point, we hear the tanks firing their 240-machine
          guns into the mosque. There's radio chatter that insurgents
          inside could be shooting back. The tanks cease fire and we
          file through a breach in the outer wall.</p>
        <p>We hear gunshots that seem to becoming from inside the
          mosque. A marine from my squad yells, "Are there marines in
          here?"</p>
        <p>When we arrive at the front entrance, we see that another
          squad has already entered before us.</p>
        <p>The lieutenant asks them, "Are there people inside?"</p>
        <p>One of the marines raises his hand signaling five.</p>
        <p>"Did you shoot them," the lieutenant asks?</p>
        <p>"Roger that, sir, " the same marine responds.</p>
        <p>"Were they armed?" The marine just shrugs and we all move
          inside.</p>
        <p>Immediately after going in, I see the same black plastic body
          bags spread around the mosque. The dead from the day before.
          But more surprising, I see the same five men that were wounded
          from Friday as well. It appears that one of them is now dead
          and three are bleeding to death from new gunshot wounds.</p>
        <p>The fifth is partially covered by a blanket and is in the
          same place and condition he was in on Friday, near a column.
          He has not been shot again. I look closely at both the dead
          and the wounded. There don't appear to be any weapons
          anywhere.</p>
        <p>"These were the same wounded from yesterday," I say to the
          lieutenant. He takes a look around and goes outside the mosque
          with his radio operator to call in the situation to Battalion
          Forward HQ.</p>
        <p>I see an old man in a red kaffiyeh lying against the back
          wall. Another is face down next to him, his hand on the old
          man's lap - as if he were trying to take cover. I squat beside
          them, inches away and begin to videotape them. Then I notice
          that the blood coming from the old man's nose is bubbling. A
          sign he is still breathing. So is the man next to him.</p>
        <p>While I continue to tape, a marine walks up to the other two
          bodies about 15 feet away, but also lying against the same
          back wall.</p>
        <p>Then I hear him say this about one of the men:</p>
        <p>"He's fucking faking he's dead - he's faking he's fucking
          dead."</p>
        <p>Through my viewfinder I can see him raise the muzzle of his
          rifle in the direction of the wounded Iraqi. There are no
          sudden movements, no reaching or lunging.</p>
        <p>However, the marine could legitimately believe the man poses
          some kind of danger. Maybe he's going to cover him while
          another marine searches for weapons.</p>
        <p>Instead, he pulls the trigger. There is a small splatter
          against the back wall and the man's leg slumps down.</p>
        <p>"Well he's dead now," says another marine in the background.</p>
        <p>I am still rolling. I feel the deep pit of my stomach. The
          marine then abruptly turns away and strides away, right past
          the fifth wounded insurgent lying next to a column. He is very
          much alive and peering from his blanket.</p>
        <p>He is moving, even trying to talk. But for some reason, it
          seems he did not pose the same apparent "danger" as the other
          man - though he may have been more capable of hiding a weapon
          or explosive beneath his blanket.</p>
        <p>But then two other marines in the room raise their weapons as
          the man tries to talk.</p>
        <p>For a moment, I'm paralysed still taping with the old man in
          the foreground. I get up after a beat and tell the marines
          again, what I had told the lieutenant - that this man - all of
          these wounded men - were the same ones from yesterday. That
          they had been disarmed treated and left here.</p>
        <p>At that point the marine who fired the shot became aware that
          I was in the room. He came up to me and said, "I didn't know
          sir - I didn't know." The anger that seemed present just
          moments before turned to fear and dread.</p>
        <p>The wounded man then tries again to talk to me in Arabic.</p>
        <p>He says, "Yesterday I was shot ... please ... yesterday I was
          shot over there - and talked to all of you on camera - I am
          one of the guys from this whole group. I gave you information.
          Do you speak Arabic? I want to give you information."</p>
        <p>(This man has since reportedly been located by the Naval
          Criminal Investigation Service which is handling the case.)</p>
        <p>In the aftermath, the first question that came to mind was
          why had these wounded men been left in the mosque?</p>
        <p>It was answered by staff judge advocate Lieutenant Colonel
          Bob Miller - who interviewed the marines involved following
          the incident. After being treated for their wounds on Friday
          by a navy corpsman (I personally saw their bandages) the
          insurgents were going to be transported to the rear when time
          and circumstances allowed.</p>
        <p>The area, however, was still hot. And there were American
          casualties to be moved first.</p>
        <p>Also, the squad that entered the mosque on Saturday was
          different than the one that had led the attack on Friday.</p>
        <p>It's reasonable to presume they may not have known that these
          insurgents had already been engaged and subdued a day earlier.</p>
        <p>Yet when this new squad engaged the wounded insurgents on
          Saturday, perhaps really believing they had been fighting or
          somehow posed a threat - those marines inside knew from their
          training to check the insurgents for weapons and explosives
          after disabling them, instead of leaving them where they were
          and waiting outside the mosque for the squad I was following
          to arrive.</p>
        <p>During the course of these events, there were plenty of
          mitigating circumstances like the ones just mentioned and
          which I reported in my story. The marine who fired the shot
          had reportedly been shot in the face himself the day before.</p>
        <p>I'm also well aware from many years as a war reporter that
          there have been times, especially in this conflict, when dead
          and wounded insurgents have been booby-trapped, even
          supposedly including an incident that happened just a block
          away from the mosque in which one marine was killed and five
          others wounded. Again, a detail that was clearly stated in my
          television report.</p>
        <p>No one, especially someone like me who has lived in a war
          zone, would deny that a soldier or marine could legitimately
          err on the side of caution under those circumstances. War is
          about killing your enemy before he kills you.</p>
        <p>In the particular circumstance I was reporting, it bothered
          me that the marine didn't seem to consider the other
          insurgents a threat - the one very obviously moving under the
          blanket, or even the two next to me that were still breathing.</p>
        <p>I can't know what was in the mind of that marine. He is the
          only one who does.</p>
        <p>But observing all of this as an experienced war reporter who
          always bore in mind the perils of this conflict, even knowing
          the possibilities of mitigating circumstances - it appeared to
          me very plainly that something was not right. According to Lt
          Col Bob Miller, the rules of engagement in Falluja required
          soldiers or marines to determine hostile intent before using
          deadly force. I was not watching from a hundred feet away. I
          was in the same room. Aside from breathing, I did not observe
          any movement at all.</p>
        <p>Making sure you know the basis for my choices after the
          incident is as important to me as knowing how the incident
          went down.</p>
        <p>I did not in any way feel like I had captured some kind of
          "prize" video. In fact, I was heartsick. Immediately after the
          mosque incident, I told the unit's commanding officer what had
          happened. I shared the video with him, and its impact rippled
          all the way up the chain of command. Marine commanders
          immediately pledged their cooperation.</p>
        <p>We all knew it was a complicated story and, if not handled
          responsibly, could have the potential to further inflame the
          volatile region. I offered to hold the tape until they had
          time to look into incident and begin an investigation -
          providing me with information that would fill in some of the
          blanks. </p>
        <p>For those who don't practise journalism as a profession, it
          may be difficult to understand why we must report stories like
          this at all - especially if they seem to be aberrations, and
          not representative of the behaviour or character of an
          organisation as a whole. </p>
        <p>The answer is not an easy one. </p>
        <p>In war, as in life, there are plenty of opportunities to see
          the full spectrum of good and evil that people are capable of.
          As journalists, it is our job is to report both - though
          neither may be fully representative of those people on whom
          we're reporting. </p>
        <p>But our coverage of these unique events, combined with the
          larger perspective, will allow the truth of that situation, in
          all of its complexities, to begin to emerge. That doesn't make
          the decision to report events like this one any easier. It
          has, for me, led to an agonising struggle - the proverbial
          long, dark night of the soul.</p>
        <p>When NBC aired the story 48 hours later, we did so in a way
          that attempted to highlight every possible mitigating issue
          for that marine's actions. We wanted viewers to have a very
          clear understanding of the circumstances surrounding the
          fighting on that frontline. Many of our colleagues were just
          as responsible.</p>
        <p>Other foreign networks made different decisions, and because
          of that, I have become the conflicted conduit who has brought
          this to the world.</p>
        <p>I interviewed your commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel
          Willy Buhl, before the battle for Falluja began. He said
          something very powerful at the time - something that now seems
          prophetic. It was this:</p>
        <p>"We're the good guys. We are Americans. We are fighting a
          gentleman's war here - because we don't behead people, we
          don't come down to the same level of the people we're
          combating.</p>
        <p>"That's a very difficult thing for a young 18-year-old marine
          who's been trained to locate, close with and destroy the enemy
          with fire and close combat. That's a very difficult thing for
          a 42-year-old lieutenant colonel with 23 years experience in
          the service who was trained to do the same thing once upon a
          time, and who now has a thousand-plus men to lead, guide,
          coach, mentor - and ensure we remain the good guys and keep
          the moral high ground." I listened carefully when he said
          those words. I believed them.</p>
        <p>So here, ultimately, is how it all plays out: when the Iraqi
          man in the mosque posed a threat, he was your enemy; when he
          was subdued he was your responsibility; when he was killed in
          front of my eyes and my camera - the story of his death became
          my responsibility.</p>
        <p>The burdens of war, as you so well know, are unforgiving for
          all of us.</p>
        <p>I pray for your soon and safe return.</p>
