                lecture, discussion, and&nbsp; writing you&#8217;ll get to
                know philosophy&#8217;s major divisions, including
                epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics, and some of the
                puzzles that philosophers think about. Is the outside
                world as it appears to be? Does God exist? Are we free?
                How should we lead our lives? You will learn about and
                evaluate major thinkers' answers to questions like
                these. You will also enhance your critical thinking
                skills so that your beliefs can be better grounded in
                logic, deepened by an understanding of the issues at
                stake, and tempered with an appreciation of opposing

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Academic integrity. </span>We








































                learn from others. So I expect words and ideas from
                other people (readings, classmates, me, research you do,
                etc.) to show up in your work. But we must acknowledge
                everyone who helped us. So, whenever others' words or
                ideas appear in your work, you must cite them whether
                you quote them or not. <br>
                <br>
                I take academic integrity very seriously and I expect
                you to. Often, cheating is unintended, but even then it
                is a serious offense and I may charge you with
                misconduct. The minimum penalty is usually worse than
                turning in no work at all, and penalties can include
                failing the course, suspension, or expulsion. Much
                plagiarism is due to ignorance of the standards and
                requirements for documenting sources, so I urge you to:<br>

                  they possess us also, filling us with thoughts and
