                        were, for centuries, considered the definitive
                        discussions of many areas of science and
                        philosophy (both of which used to be called
                        "philosophy," by the way)--so much so that
                        Aristotle was sometimes referred to simply as
                        "the Philosopher" and his statement on any
                        subject was considered authoritative. <br>
                        <br>
                        The <span style="font-style: italic;">Rhetoric</span>
                        was written around 350 BCE and has been studied
                        ever since. In it, Aristotle is concerned with <span
                          style="font-style: italic;">all </span>kinds
                        of persuasion, not just persuasion with logic.
                        In Part 1 he explains why rhetoric is important.
                        In Part 2 he discusses different "modes" of
                        persuasion: <span style="font-style: italic;">ethos</span>,
                        <span style="font-style: italic;">pathos</span>,
                        and <span style="font-style: italic;">logos</span>.
                        In philosophy, we mostly use just one of the
                        three modes he discusses in paragraph 7--<span
                          style="font-style: italic;">logos </span>or
                        logical reasoning--because we think it is the
                        one most relevant to finding the truth. But you
                        should be aware of the other modes and be on the
                        watch for them, not only in this course but in
                        all parts of your life. <br>

                    the counterpart of Dialectic [<a target="_blank"
                      href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-rhetoric/#dialectic">a
                      kind of reasoning</a>]. Both alike are concerned
                    with such things as come, more or less, within the
                    general ken of all men and belong to no definite
                    science. Accordingly all men make use, more or less,
                    of both; for to a certain extent all men attempt to
                    discuss statements and to maintain [i.e., defend
                    their belief in] them, to defend themselves and to
                    attack others. Ordinary people do this either at
                    random or through practice and from acquired habit.
                    Both ways being possible, the subject can plainly be
                    handled systematically, for it is possible to
                    inquire the reason why some speakers succeed through
                    practice and others spontaneously; and every one
                    will at once agree that such an inquiry is the
                    function of an art.<br>

                    strict sense, is concerned with the modes of
                    persuasion. Persuasion is clearly a sort of
                    demonstration, since we are most fully persuaded
                    when we consider a thing to have been demonstrated.</span><span

                    is useful (1) because things that are true and
                    things that are just have a natural tendency to
                    prevail over their opposites, so that if the
                    decisions of judges are not what they ought to be,
                    the defeat must be due to the speakers themselves,
                    and they must be blamed accordingly. Moreover, (2)
                    before some audiences not even the possession of the
                    exactest knowledge will make it easy for what we say
                    to produce conviction. For argument based on
                    knowledge implies instruction, and there are people
                    whom one cannot instruct. Here, then, we must use,
                    as our modes of persuasion and argument, notions
                    possessed by everybody, as we observed in the <a
                      style=" font-style: italic;" target="_blank"
                      href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/topics.1.i.html">Topics</a><span
                      style="font-style: italic;"> </span>when dealing
                    with the way to handle a popular audience. Further,
                    (3) we must be able to employ persuasion, just as
                    strict reasoning can be employed, on opposite sides
                    of a question, not in order that we may in practice
                    employ it in both ways (for we must not make people
                    believe what is wrong), but in order that we may see
                    clearly what the facts are, and that, if another man
                    argues unfairly, we on our part may be able to <a
                      target="_blank"
                      href="http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/confute">confute</a>
                    him. No other of the arts draws opposite
                    conclusions: dialectic and rhetoric alone do this.
                    Both these arts draw opposite conclusions
                    impartially. Nevertheless, the underlying facts do
                    not lend themselves equally well to the contrary
                    views. No; things that are true and things that are
                    better are, by their nature, practically always
                    easier to prove and easier to believe in. Again, (4)
                    it is absurd to hold that a man ought to be ashamed
                    of being unable to defend himself with his limbs,
                    but not of being unable to defend himself with
                    speech and reason, when the use of rational speech
                    is more distinctive of a human being than the use of
                    his limbs. And if it be objected that one who uses
                    such power of speech unjustly might do great harm,
                    that is a charge which may be made in common against
                    all good things except virtue, and above all against
                    the things that are most useful, as strength,
                    health, wealth, generalship. A man can confer the
                    greatest of benefits by a right use of these, and
                    inflict the greatest of injuries by using them
                    wrongly.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;
                    font-family: Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-weight: normal; font-family:
                    Georgia;">[4]&nbsp; It is clear, then, that rhetoric
                    is not bound up with a single definite class of
                    subjects, but is as universal as dialectic; it is
                    clear, also, that it is useful. It is clear,
                    further, that its function is not simply to succeed
                    in persuading, but rather to discover the means of
                    coming as near such success as the circumstances of
                    each particular case allow. In this it resembles all
                    other arts. For example, it is not the function of
                    medicine simply to make a man quite healthy, but to
                    put him as far as may be on the road to health; it
                    is possible to give excellent treatment even to
                    those who can never enjoy sound health. Furthermore,
                    it is plain that it is the function of one and the
                    same art to discern the real and the apparent means
                    of persuasion, just as it is the function of
                    dialectic to discern the real and the apparent
                    syllogism. What makes a man a 'sophist' is not his
                    faculty, but his moral purpose. In rhetoric,
                    however, the term 'rhetorician' may describe either
                    the speaker's knowledge of the art, or his moral
                    purpose. In dialectic it is different: a man is a
                    'sophist' because he has a certain kind of moral
                    purpose, a 'dialectician' in respect, not of his
                    moral purpose, but of his faculty.</span><br

                    account of the systematic principles of Rhetoric
                    itself--of the right method and means of succeeding
                    in the object we set before us. We must make as it
                    were a fresh start, and before going further define
                    what rhetoric is.</span><br style="font-weight:

                  <span style="font-weight: normal; font-family:

                    faculty of observing in <span style="font-style:
                      italic;">any </span>given case the available
                    means of persuasion. This is not a function of any
                    other art. Every other art can instruct or persuade
                    about its own particular subject-matter; for
                    instance, medicine about what is healthy and
                    unhealthy, geometry about the properties of
                    magnitudes, arithmetic about numbers, and the same
                    is true of the other arts and sciences. But rhetoric
                    we look upon as the power of observing the means of
                    persuasion on almost any subject presented to us;
                    and that is why we say that, in its technical
                    character, it is not concerned with any special or
                    definite class of subjects.</span><br

                    [7]&nbsp; Of the modes of persuasion furnished by
                    the spoken word there are three kinds. The first
                    kind [<span style="font-style: italic;">ethos</span>]
                    depends on the personal character of the speaker;
                    the second [<span style="font-style: italic;">pathos</span>]
                    on putting the audience into a certain frame of
                    mind; the third [<span style="font-style: italic;">logos</span>]
                    on the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the
                    words of the speech itself. Persuasion is achieved
                    by the speaker's personal character [<span
                      style="font-style: italic;">ethos</span>] when the
                    speech is so spoken as to make us think him
                    credible. We believe good men more fully and more
                    readily than others: this is true generally whatever
                    the question is, and absolutely true where exact
                    certainty is impossible and opinions are divided.
                    This kind of persuasion, like the others, should be
                    achieved by what the speaker says, not by what
                    people think of his character before he begins to
                    speak. It is not true, as some writers assume in
                    their treatises on rhetoric, that the personal
                    goodness revealed by the speaker contributes nothing
                    to his power of persuasion; on the contrary, his
                    character may almost be called the most effective
                    means of persuasion he possesses. Secondly,
                    persuasion may come through the hearers, when the
                    speech stirs their emotions [<span
                      style="font-style: italic;">pathos</span>]. Our
                    judgements when we are pleased and friendly are not
                    the same as when we are pained and hostile. It is
                    towards producing these effects, as we maintain,
                    that present-day writers on rhetoric direct the
                    whole of their efforts. This subject shall be
                    treated in detail when we come to speak of the
                    emotions. Thirdly, persuasion is effected through
                    the speech itself when we have proved a truth or an
                    apparent truth by means of the persuasive arguments
                    suitable to the case in question [<span
                      style="font-style: italic;">logos</span>].</span><br
                    style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Georgia;">
                  <br style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Georgia;">
                  <span style="font-weight: normal; font-family:
                    Georgia;">[8]&nbsp; There are, then, these three
                    means of effecting persuasion. The man who is to be
                    in command of them must, it is clear, be able (1) to
                    reason logically, (2) to understand human character
                    and goodness in their various forms, and (3) to
                    understand the emotions--that is, to name them and
                    describe them, to know their causes and the way in
                    which they are excited. It thus appears that
                    rhetoric is an offshoot of dialectic and also of
                    ethical studies. Ethical studies may fairly be
                    called political; and for this reason rhetoric
                    masquerades as political science, and the professors
                    of it as political experts--sometimes from want of
                    education, sometimes from ostentation, sometimes
                    owing to other human failings. As a matter of fact,
                    it is a branch of dialectic and similar to it, as we
                    said at the outset. Neither rhetoric nor dialectic
                    is the scientific study of any one separate subject:
                    both are faculties for providing arguments. This is
                    perhaps a sufficient account of their scope and of
                    how they are related to each other.</span></font></td>
