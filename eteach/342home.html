            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Through reading and
              discussing the assigned texts, we will critically examine
              some of the many philosophical issues arising in the law,
              such as the proper application of law, the nature and
              basis of law, how law may be interpreted, whether law
              should protect us from ourselves or enforce morality, how
              punishment is justified, and others of your choice. We
              will read essays on these topics and examine legal
              rulings. By the end you should:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>Have a basic understanding of the structure of the
                  US legal system and of dominant ethical theories
                  relevant to legal thinking</li>
                <li>Enhance your knowledge of important terms and
                  sharpen your ability to identify and evaluate
                  philosophical arguments</li>
                <li>Understand important points of view on the issues we
                  discuss</li>
                <li>Critically reflect on the above</li>
                <li>Appreciate the complexity of these issues and be
                  able to take a reasoned stand on them</li>
                <li>Enhance your skills at research, writing, and
                  speaking</li>
                <li>Demonstrate the above in assignments and discussion</li>

              either the 5th edition (ISBN 9781133049999) or the 4th
              edition (ISBN 9780534584283). Both are pictured here. <br>

              Copies should be available at Eli's Books but you can find
              them much cheaper online. Used copies of the 4th edition
              will be cheapest and will work fine. Other readings will
              be linked from <a href="342outreadsMWF.html">our

              You will need a copy of the Constitution of the United

              arguments, theories, etc. will come up in readings,
              lectures, presentations, and discussion. As you might
              expect, your grade will depend on how well you show that
              you understand and have thought about that material. Where
              independent research is required, your grade will also
              depend on the quality of that research and demonstrating
              that you understand and have thought about that material.
              Though it has no specific prerequisites this is a
              300-level course so my expectations for the quality of
              your work will be higher than in 100- or 200-level
              courses. (First-year students should find another course
              immediately.) The course grade will be derived as follows:

                  the presentations page</a>, but here&#8217;s a quick
                description. Each individual/group will take
                responsibility for researching a topic within the
                philosophy of law and presenting it to the class. Your
                presentations are part of the course (their contents
                will be fair game for the final exam, for example), so
                they need to be done well, and I will help you do well.
                I can suggest presentation topics, but it's best if you

                defend your view against serious opposition. The
                research must be substantial. Your topic may be related
                to that of your presentation or a short paper. You will
                develop the paper in stages: first a short proposal for

                Otherwise, there is no guarantee they can be provided

              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">To enable class
                interaction, class will be taught synchronously if
                possible, meeting via video conference during the hours
                in the schedule of classes. This means we will be
                virtually visiting people's living spaces. Class
                meetings will be recorded to serve as a learning
                resource for the class. To respect your classmates, me,
                and those you live with: <br>
                <ul>
                  <li> Do not share those recordings or any portion of
                    them outside the class.</li>
                  <li>Keep your camera on. (If this won't work for you,
                    please see me to talk about it.)<br>
                  </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li> There are advantages to having cameras on.
                      Having faces visible enables lip-reading and
                      interpreting facial expressions, which help us
                      better understand each other. </li>
                    <li>You can prevent others from seeing your living
                      space by using a background image or blurred
                      background.</li>
                    <li>Mind what your camera shows to others. For
                      example, liquor bottles visible in an underage
                      student's dorm room could be a problem. So could
                      racist or otherwise offensive posters or
                      paraphernalia in the background. Let's avoid that.

              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Reading is an act of
                contemplation, perhaps the only act in which we allow
                ourselves to merge with the consciousness of another
                human being. We possess the books we read, animating the
                waiting stillness of their language, but they possess us
                also, filling us with thoughts and observations, asking
                us to make them part of ourselves.... In order for this
                to work, however, we need a certain type of silence, an
                ability to filter out the noise.<br>

              Make time, in a quiet space, to read. Not just once, not
              quickly like it&#8217;s a news article, but deeply. Turn off
              your TV, phone, radio, MP3. When reading online, close all
              other windows, set Skype to offline, turn off chats, and
              release yourself from Facebook etc. Philosophical texts
              reward focused, careful, and repeated reading. Besides,
              you can expect me to call on you with questions about it,
              and grasping the readings is helpful for doing well on
              exams and papers.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Some good ways to help
                yourself prepare</span> are <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Read the introductory material for each chapter and
                  section in your textbook as we go</li>
                <li>Try to answer some of the relevant study questions
                  in your textbook after each reading</li>
                <li>Write more reading responses than required</li>
                <li>Bring the current reading and your notes and reading
                  responses with you to class</li>
              </ul>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Take detailed notes. </span>Just




































              copying what&#8217;s on the board or screen (or whatever I'm
              doing in class) may not be enough. If the notes you take
              during class are sketchy, take a moment after class to
              fill them out.<br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Participate a lot. </span>Some




































              students assume their questions aren't worth asking or
              their comments not worth making, but often others wanted
              to say the same thing. Don&#8217;t allow yourself to stay
              confused or lost. If you are not comfortable speaking in
              class, see me outside it.<br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">If you miss class, </span>make




































              arrangements with others to share notes with you. I
              suggest agreeing with at least two other people in the
              class, at the beginning of the semester, to share notes.
              If class is taught remotely, watch the recordings. <br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Give yourself time to
                write good papers. </span>Haste never makes for better
              writing. Allow time to seek help at the W center and from
              me well before your paper is due.<br>
