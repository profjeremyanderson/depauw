            Office: Asbury 209; ext. 4679<br>
            Office hours: Mon, Tues, Thurs, and Fri 1:30-2:30pm and by
            appointment (don&#8217;t be shy), and pretty much any time you see
            me.<br>
            Class meets: official hours are M-F 9am - noon and 1 - 2pm,
            starting Wednesday January 3, in Julian 161. At the first
            meeting we'll adjust the meeting times (likely to from
            9:30am to approximately 12:30 - 1:30pm depending on the
            length of the films we see each day). We will not meet every
            day; actual meeting days, and the schedule of films and
            presenters, will be on this Google Doc which I will update
            as we go.<br>

            <br>
            What is real? What is our place in the world? Who am I?
            What&#8217;s important in life? Am I free or are my choices
            foreordained? And how can we learn more about these issues
            by watching movies? This course will explore some of the
            deep, heavy questions of philosophy through the (relatively)
            light, convenient medium of films such as The Truman Show,
            American Beauty, Being John Malkovich, and others of your
            choice. Readings will point us to the issues to watch for in
            each film, which we will discuss after viewing. Assignments
            will include readings, viewings, and written reactions to
            them. Students will form groups, and each group will lead
            discussion of a given film. Students will be evaluated on
            participation in discussions, consistency and quality of
            written work, and film-discussion leading.<br>

            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Assignment instructions and
              grading</span><br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Here are your four
              assignments:</span><br>
            <br>
            1. Respond to daily reading assignments by 7:00pm the night
            before each film. Reading(s) will be assigned prior to each
            class meeting. Write a response to each day&#8217;s readings,
            totaling 350 words minimum not including your name etc., and
            upload it to the class Moodle page. In each response:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Summarize each assigned reading.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, identify the main issues
            discussed in the readings in a way that demonstrates you
            read everything carefully. If more than one reading is
            assigned, you must summarize each reading.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Separately from the summary/ies,
            critically reflect on at least one of the readings.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, you might explain why you
            think the reading or some portion of it is especially
            insightful, interesting, or wrongheaded -- disagreement is
            encouraged! You might relate it to some other reading(s),
            film(s), etc.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may not simply express your personal
            opinion. You must not simply say &#8220;I think...&#8221; or "I feel" or
            &#8220;It seems to me that....&#8221; Rather, you must strive to provide
            good reason(s) for why any reasonable person should agree
            with you.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Employ correct grammar, spelling, word
            usage, etc. Excessive errors are grounds for failing a
            reading response.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Want to see what an "excellent" (4)
            response looks like? Here are two samples (PDF).<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Submit responses in Microsoft Word or RTF
            format (.doc or .docx or .rtf; no Pages!), with the file
            named after the film, like this: TheTrumanShow.docx (or .doc
            or .rtf). <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the top of your reading response put
            your name, the title of the film, and a word count for the
            text of your response (i.e., do not count your name, film
            title, etc.).<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Submit your response to the drop box for
            that film here on Moodle so that they are time-stamped by
            7:00pm the night before the class meeting for which the
            readings are assigned. Responses time-stamped 7:01 or later
            will be deemed late (see late policies below), so manage
            your time and get them in sooner than that.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Moodle is unavailable you may e-mail
            me your response (jeremyanderson@depauw.edu); the deadline
            is the same.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            2. Participate in in-class discussions every day. At the
            beginning of each meeting we will discuss the day&#8217;s readings
            for a bit and then watch the day&#8217;s film. Then after a short
            break we&#8217;ll discuss the film in more depth. You must
            participate in those discussions, and do so in a way that
            demonstrates both having done the reading and having paid
            careful attention to the film. You should take note of
            things you&#8217;d like to talk about as you do the readings and
            as you watch the films, and keep those notes in front of
            you. I expect you to participate every day.<br>
            <br>
            3. Participate in after-class online discussions by (a)
            posting your own view and (b) responding to someone else's
            post by 7:00pm the day each film is shown. I have set up
            online discussion forums on the class Moodle site for each
            film. When posting your own view, remember to give reasons
            why other reasonable people should agree with you. When
            responding to someone else's post you may agree or disagree,
            in whole or in part, but, again, give reasons why others
            should accept your view. The more you show thoughtfulness
            and critical reflection on course materials, the better. As
            in your reading responses, proper grammar, spelling, etc.
            are required; excessive errors are grounds for failing. Your
            online postings will be due by 7:00pm after each class
            meeting. Postings time-stamped 7:01pm or later will be
            deemed late (see late policies below).<br>
            <br>
            4. Small-group presentation and discussion leading. I will
            lead the first few class meetings. After that, you will
            lead. That is, you will form groups of two (maybe three) in
            the first week of class and each group will pick a film and
            a date to present it. Then, each pair will view the film in
            advance of that day, research it, and master the reading(s)
            assigned for that film. Finally, on the day the film is
            shown the group will do a presentation on that film prior to
            our watching it and lead discussion afterwards. Each person
            in each group will be graded for their individual
            contribution. Presentations will be evaluated based on:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How effectively you identify the relevant
            philosophical issues in the reading(s) and film and prepare
            the class for viewing the film, and<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How effectively you lead discussion after
            the film is shown.<br>
            <br>
            Presenting your film is a major assignment, worth 25% of
            your grade for the course -- and to pass the course with an
            "S" you must earn a score of at least 2 on your
            presentation. This assignment requires substantial work.
            Instructions for preparing your presentation are posted to
            the class web page. I expect everyone to follow them. You
            will also find a list of philosophical issues with films
            (most of which are available from Roy O. West Library or
            Putnam County Public Library two blocks from campus) which
            explore those issues; you may also propose films not on the
            list.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Grading</span><br>
            <br>
            Various terms, ideas, arguments, themes, etc. will come up
            in readings, lecture, presentations, discussion, and of
            course in the films we view. Your grade will depend on how
            well you demonstrate that you understand, and have thought
            about, all that material. Your grade will be derived as
            follows:<br>
            <br>
            25%&nbsp; Responses to daily reading assignments<br>
            25%&nbsp; Participation in in-class discussions<br>
            25%&nbsp; Participation in after-class online discussions<br>
            25%&nbsp; Small-group presentation and discussion leading<br>
            <br>
            This course is "S/D/U," i.e., the possible course grades are
            "Satisfactory," "D," or "Unsatisfactory." Grades of "S" or
            "D" earn credit; "U" does not. Each assignment will be
            graded 4 (= A), 3 (= B), 2 (= C), 1 (= D), or 0 (= F). No
            fractional grades (e.g., 2.5) will be given. To get an "S"
            for the course your average score for all assignments must
            be at least 1.7. Just to be clear, this means that an
            average score of, for example, 1.6999 will yield a grade of
            "D" for the course; I do not round up. An average score of
            at least 0.7 but less than 1.7 will yield a "D" for the
            course, and an average score of less than 0.7 (and again, I
            do not round up) will yield a "U" for the course. One
            exception: you will not get an "S" for the course without
            completing the presentation assignment with a score of at
            least 2 (and if you look at the presentation assignment,
            you'll see that even getting a 2 on it will require very
            substantial work).<br>
            <br>
            To summarize:<br>
            1.7 average score or greater for all assignments, including
            at least 2.0 on your presentation = S for the course<br>
            0.7 to less than 1.7 = D for the course<br>
            Less than 0.7 = U for the course (and no Winter Term credit)<br>
            Less than 2 on the presentation = D or U for the course,
            depending on your other scores.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            Disagreement is great! But keep it civilized. In philosophy,
            critical perspectives are not only allowed but prized. But
            we criticize ideas (and, in this course, characters in
            movies), not our classmates. For discussion to be productive
            we need to listen carefully, and critically, to what others
            have to say; we need to push each other to think more deeply
            and carefully; and we need to regard disagreement as a
            chance to learn from others even if ultimately we do not
            accept what they say. However, personal attacks in class or
            online are not allowed. For example, it is fine to say, "I
            really disagree with what you've said; I think that's
            mistaken because...." and proceed to give some reason(s) for
            your view. However, it is not OK to say, "Man, how can you
            believe something so stupid?"<br>
            <br>
            Be here, on time. Unless you have very strong excuse, be in
            class by 9:30am ready to rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll. Strong excuses
            include severe or contagious illness, death in the family,
            and so on. Documentation may be required. You will be
            allowed one unexcused absence. More than one will be grounds
            for a &#8220;U&#8221; in the course, and so will excessive tardiness.
            Falling asleep in class, e.g., during a film, counts as an
            unexcused absence.<br>
            <br>
            Minimize distractions in class. Please visit the restroom
            before class rather than during. Electronic devices should
            be out of sight during films, and during discussion unless
            you get specific permission from me. Cell phones, PDA&#8217;s,
            pagers, etc. must be set to vibrate only, and put away,
            unless you clear it with me beforehand. No laptops etc.
            unless you clear it with me beforehand and even then all
            technology use must be directly course-related: no texting,
            e-mail, Facebook, etc. in class. And so on: be here mentally
            as well as physically.<br>
            <br>
            Participate in in-class discussions. If you are quiet for a
            day, you will need to make sure to speak up the other days.
            If you are prevented from speaking on a given day you may
            make up for it by posting additional contributions to that
            day&#8217;s after-class online discussions. Insufficient in-class
            participation will be grounds for a failing score for this
            portion of the course.<br>
            <br>
            Use proper spelling, grammar, word usage, etc. in all
            writing for this course. Excessive&nbsp; errors in a given
            assignment are grounds for failing it, and consistent
            inattention to proper mechanics in your writing is grounds
            for a &#8220;U&#8221; in the course.<br>
            <br>
            Late reading responses get no credit without a very strong
            excuse (see "Be here, on time" above--also, "My book hasn't
            come in yet" is not an excuse). Missing two or more days&#8217;
            reading responses without a strong excuse will be grounds
            for failing this assignment regardless of how good your
            other responses are. If you run into trouble with Moodle,
            e-mail your response to jeremyanderson@depauw.edu by the
            deadline. If you have trouble getting the textbook by the
            first day of class, see me.<br>

            Late posts to after-class discussions get no credit without
            a strong excuse (see above). Missing two or more days'
            posting without a strong excuse will be grounds for failing
            this assignment regardless of how good your other
            contributions are. If you run into trouble with Moodle,

            DePauw and I are committed to providing reasonable
            accommodations to students with properly documented
            disabilities--psychiatric, attentional, learning, vision,
            hearing, physical, medical, etc. If you believe you may need
            an accommodation because of a disability or learning
            challenge, please contact Student Accessibility Services to
            learn how to receive accommodations and support. You must to
            contact them; I cannot do it for you. Student Disability
            Services' phone number is 765-658-6267, their email is
            studentaccessibility@depauw.edu. Allow one week advance
            notice to ensure enough time for accommodations to be made.
            Otherwise, there is no guarantee they can be provided when
            you need them. I cannot provide accommodations until I
            receive an official ADA letter detailing the accommodations
            you may have. Once I receive it, you must discuss with me
            how to accommodate you in this course. You may choose not to
            use accommodations, but you must accept the results.
            Accommodations are not retroactive.<br>
            <br>
            Plagiarism and other forms of dishonesty violate DePauw
            policy on academic integrity. The most common type is when
            you present another person&#8217;s ideas or words as if they were
            your own, failing to give proper credit to your sources.
            Often it is unintended, but even then it is a serious
            offense and I may prosecute you. The minimum penalty is
            worse than turning in no work at all, and penalties may
            include failing the course, suspension, or expulsion. Much
            plagiarism is due to ignorance of the standards and
            requirements for documenting sources, so I urge you to
            familiarize yourself with DePauw's policy and your
            obligations and rights, which are stated in the Academic
            Handbook, and use these resources to better understand
            academic integrity at DePauw. You can avoid many problems if
            you follow these simple rules: if you use an idea you got
            from someone or somewhere else, cite it; if you use their
            words, put them in quotes and cite.<br>

            How each class meeting will be conducted will be up to each

            You'll participate in the after-class online discussion of
            that film<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until you do your
            presentation, you will prepare for it as best you can per
