                  on the study guide, I routinely get responses that

                    false</a>. Feel free to experiment with AI's if you
                  like, but for work you turn in for credit I recommend
                  you only use material from an AI when you can verify
                  it is accurate, or as an example you critically
                  evaluate. (Which, in practice, may mean that you don't
                  use it in this course at all.)</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The more you let AI
                    do for you, the more you undermine your own
                    education.</span> Developing and practicing skills
                  in reading, critical thinking, and writing are among
                  the most important benefits of a liberal arts
                  education. Those skills matter at least as much as
                  whatever facts you learn because they are fundamental
                  to interacting intelligently with the world. Without
                  them, you cannot even assess whether AI is feeding you
                  bullshit. </li>
                <li>And, of course, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the









                    more of the work the AI does, the less credit you
                    earn.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">The policy: </span>if
              you use any AI in any way you must document how you used
              it by showing your prompts and AI's responses.
              (Screenshots are good for this.) Any use of AI that you
              fail to document is a form of plagiarism and may be
              charged as dishonesty. <br>
              <br>
              Here are some possible examples:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>If you copy any text generated by an AI (whether
                  it's just a turn of phrase or something more), put it
                  in quotation marks and cite the AI.</li>
                <li>If you use anything (such as an idea, or an example)
                  you got from an AI without copying the words, still
                  cite the AI.</li>
                <li>If you use an AI to correct your grammar, spelling,
                  punctuation, etc., or to help outline your paper, say
                  so, and cite the AI. </li>
              </ul>
              In short, if you use AI to affect the content of your work
              in any way whatsoever (wording, ideas, examples,
              arguments, grammar, punctuation, organization, etc.),
              document it. And, of course, the more work the AI does,
              the less credit you earn.<br>
              <br>
              I may use a variety of AI detectors to check your work. <br>
              <br>
              This is merely an extension of the plagiarism policy
              above, and reflects the main goal of academic integrity
              generally, which is to give credit for any help you got. <br>

              As always, if you are unsure what's OK, ask me, preferably
              before turning work in. <br>

              Like the rest of these academic integrity instructions,
              this policy applies to reading responses, drafts, papers,
              and take-home exams (if any). Citing and quoting are not
              required for in-class exams because for them you must
              write solely from memory.<br>

                you write your paper and end up at only 800 words, you
                probably need to say more. If you end up at 1500+ words,

                <li>Class notes will help you understand the argument,

                    along); or</li>
                  <li>Quote --&gt; explain --&gt; quote --&gt; explain.
                    That is, quote a premise from the text, then explain
                    for yourself what it means, then quote some more and
                    explain that, and so on until you've shown how the
                    whole argument works. For any conclusions, explain
                    how they're supposed to follow from the premises.</li>
                  <li>Or, some of each.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Be charitable. Even if you don't agree with the
                  argument, make it look as persuasive as possible
                  (without misrepresenting what the author says). <br>
                </li>
                <li>For the first paper, explaining the argument well is
                  the most important part. After that, evaluating is
                  just as important.<br>

                  argument, in 1-2 pages. </span>Argue for why some
                objection(s) shows, or fails to show, the argument is
                unsound or weak.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>For the first paper, this part is less important
                  than presenting the argument. After that, evaluating
                  is just as important.</li>
                <li>State just one or two objections. More than that
                  will not work in a short paper.</li>
                <li>Choose good objections, not easily dismissed.</li>
                <li>Rather than say why you personally think an argument
                  is good or bad, explain why any reasonable person
                  should agree with your assessment.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Using an objection from the text or class? Fine!
                  Cite it! From something you found on the internet?
                  Cite it! From a chat with a friend, a relative, space
                  aliens, or any other source? Cite!</li>
                <li>Evaluating the argument doesn't have to mean showing
                  the argument is bad. Maybe it turns out the argument
                  is good -- or at least that some objection(s) fail to
                  show it's bad. There are many ways a paper can go.
                  Here are some you might try:</li>

              <ul>
                <ol>
                  <li>Here's the argument. Here's an objection. Here's
                    why the objection shows the argument is bad. The
                    end. <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Here's the argument. Here's an objection. The
                    objection, though, fails to show the argument is
                    bad. So, the argument is immune to that objection. <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Here's the argument. Here's an objection. Here's
                    why this objection fails. But wait, here's another
                    objection, and it succeeds. So the argument is bad.</li>
                  <li>Here's an argument. Here's an objection. Oh, and
                    here's another. But here's why they both fail to
                    show the argument is bad. So the argument is immune
                    to both those objections.<br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                  <li>Of these, #1 and #2 are okay; #3 and #4 show more

                  article is too is too long to discuss all of, so
                  discuss some substantial part. You might consider...<br>
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>How persuasively does he argue that we have no
                    free will (sections 1-2). You might focus on his
                    comparison of the stone, the donkey, and us.</li>
                  <li>How persuasively does he argue that we only think
                    we are free because we are ignorant of what causes
                    our actions (section 4)?<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>How persuasively does he argue that we are not
                    morally responsible (section 5)?</li>
                </ul>
                <li>C.A. Campbell: his article, too, is too long to
                  discuss all of, so you could discuss some substantial
                  part, like...</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>How persuasively does he show that some of our
                    choices are free?</li>
                  <li>How persuasively does he show that arguments for
                    determinism are faulty? (No need to discuss all the
                    arguments he considers in sections 8 and 9! You
                    might just discuss how he disputes the argument from
                    predictability in section 9.)<br>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>A.J. Ayer: again, discuss some substantial part,
                  like...</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Is he right to believe we can't tell whether
                    determinism is true? Or...<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>How about his argument that we cannot be
                    responsible if our choices are undetermined? Or...</li>
                  <li>He thinks we can tell which actions people are
                    responsible for by which acts are "constrained." How
                    persuasive is he here?<br>

              Explain the view you're going to evaluate clearly and
              completely. This is the most important part of this paper.
              Then critically evaluate that view. You might do this by
              explaining why some objection shows, or fails to show,
              that view is unpersuasive. Don't try to give more than one
              or two objections; one objection well done is better than
              two or more not done well. For this paper, the critical
              evaluation is less important than explaining the view
              well. <br>
              <br>
              Your paper should be about 1000-1300 words, i.e., about
              3-4 pages (but don't worry much about length; <a
