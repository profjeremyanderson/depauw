            <br>
            Paper assignments will require you to express challenging
            ideas clearly and accurately and critically appraise them
            fairly. Further details will be posted here as the course

                    href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ceo-google-ai-hallucinations">are
                    false</a>. Feel free to experiment with AI's if you
                  like, but for work you turn in for credit I recommend
                  you only use material from an AI when you can verify
                  it is accurate, or as an example you critically
                  evaluate. (Which, in practice, may mean that you don't
                  use it in this course at all.)</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The more you let AI
                    do for you, the more you undermine your own
                    education.</span> Developing and practicing skills
                  in reading, critical thinking, and writing are among
                  the most important benefits of a liberal arts
                  education. Those skills matter at least as much as
                  whatever facts you learn because they are fundamental
                  to interacting intelligently with the world. Without
                  them, you cannot even assess whether AI is feeding you
                  bullshit. </li>
              </ul>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">The policy: </span>if
              you use any AI in any way you must document how you used
              it. <br>
              <br>
              Here are some possible examples:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>If you copy any text generated by an AI (whether
                  it's just a turn of phrase or something more), put it
                  in quotation marks and cite the AI.</li>
                <li>If you use anything (such as an idea, or an example)
                  you got from an AI without copying the words, still
                  cite the AI.</li>
                <li>If you use an AI to correct your grammar, spelling,
                  punctuation, etc., or to help outline your paper, say
                  so, and cite the AI. </li>
              </ul>
              In short, if you use AI to affect the content of your work
              in any way whatsoever (wording, ideas, examples,
              arguments, grammar, punctuation, organization, etc.),
              document it. And, of course, the more work the AI does,
              the less credit you earn.<br>
              <br>
              I may use a variety of AI detectors to check your work. <br>
              <br>
              This is merely an extension of the plagiarism policy
              above, and reflects the main goal of academic integrity
              generally, which is to give credit for any help you got. <br>
              <br>
              As always, if you are unsure what's OK, ask me, preferably
              before turning work in. <br>
              <br>
              Like the rest of these academic integrity instructions,
              this policy applies to reading responses, drafts, papers,
              and take-home exams (if any). Citing and quoting are not
              required for in-class exams because for them you must
              write solely from memory.<br>

                  in parentheses, like this: (Descartes, 145) or (Locke,
                  187). Only cite Bailey for things Bailey wrote, like

                  and the paragraph number, like this: (Behe, 21). You
                  may also use section numbers when they're available,
                  as they are in Locke and Berkeley, like this: (Locke,
                  185, &sect;4) or (Berkeley, &sect;18).&nbsp; <br>

                  Design, 4:13). After you give the full title the first
                  time you cite it, you may abbreviate the title:<br>

                  assigned texts or videos. The original source -- the
                  text or video -- is usually a richer source. Also,
                  since we're fallible, notes may be inaccurate. Use the
                  notes to help yourself understand the original source
                  and, if you use words or ideas from notes, you <span

                  and/or cite them. But, as much as you can, work from

                  the class and date, either like (Phil 101, 2021-02-05)

                    meeting </span>(for classes taught remotely):

                  where the cited material begins: (Phil 101,

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Citing outside
                    sources. </span>No research outside of assigned
                  texts is needed in this course, and if you don't cite
                  anything besides class and assigned texts or videos, I
                  don't require a "works cited" page. But if you use any

                  cannot tell who the author is, and that the author is
                  qualified to write about your topic, you probably
                  should not use that source. When in doubt, either ask
                  me or do not use the source.<br>

                    sources in Chicago or Turabian format, </span>using
                  the parenthetical citations/reference list style. In
                  other words, cite an outside source in parentheses --
                  like (Miyazaki, 247) -- wherever you use it in your
                  work, and provide a bibliography. You must include the

                  But you must still cite it. It's easy: just give the

                are two important reasons for this. First, it's a

              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>Class notes will help you understand the argument,
                  but a paper that does nothing but write up notes or
                  copy from the blackboard won't be very good. Try to

                <li>Explain the whole argument, as if to someone who has
                  never heard of it.</li>
                <li>Here are some good ways to do that:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Explain it all in your own words (but citing all
                    along); or</li>
                  <li>Quote --&gt; explain --&gt; quote --&gt; explain.
                    That is, quote a premise from the text, then explain
                    for yourself what it means, then quote some more and
                    explain that, and so on until you've shown how the
                    whole argument works. For any conclusions, explain
                    how they're supposed to follow from the premises.</li>
                  <li>Or, some of each.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Be charitable. Even if you don't agree with the
                  argument, make it look as persuasive as possible
                  (without misrepresenting what the author says). <br>
                </li>
                <li>For the first paper, explaining the argument well is
                  the most important part. After that, evaluating is
                  just as important.<br>

                </li>
              </ul>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third, evaluate that
                  argument, in 1-2 pages. </span>Argue for why some
                objection(s) shows, or fails to show, the argument is
                unsound or weak.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>For the first paper, this part is less important
                  than presenting the argument. After that, evaluating
                  is just as important.</li>
                <li>State just one or two objections. More than that
                  will not work in a short paper.</li>
                <li>Choose good objections, not easily dismissed.</li>
                <li>Rather than say why you personally think an argument
                  is good or bad, explain why any reasonable person
                  should agree with your assessment.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Using an objection from the text or class? Fine!
                  Cite it! From something you found on the internet?
                  Cite it! From a chat with a friend, a relative, space
                  aliens, or any other source? Cite!</li>
                <li>Evaluating the argument doesn't have to mean showing
                  the argument is bad. Maybe it turns out the argument
                  is good -- or at least that some objection(s) fail to
                  show it's bad. There are many ways a paper can go.
                  Here are some you might try:</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <ol>
                  <li>Here's the argument. Here's an objection. Here's
                    why the objection shows the argument is bad. The
                    end. <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Here's the argument. Here's an objection. The
                    objection, though, fails to show the argument is
                    bad. So, the argument is immune to that objection. <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Here's the argument. Here's an objection. Here's
                    why this objection fails. But wait, here's another
                    objection, and it succeeds. So the argument is bad.</li>
                  <li>Here's an argument. Here's an objection. Oh, and
                    here's another. But here's why they both fail to
                    show the argument is bad. So the argument is immune
                    to both those objections.<br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                  <li>Of these, #1 and #2 are okay; #3 and #4 show more
                    sophistication, which is even better. But: one
                    objection well presented and discussed is just fine!
                    And for the first paper, presenting the argument
                    well matters the most. <br>
