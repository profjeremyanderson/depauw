                Academic Integrity Policy</a>.<br>
              <br>
              The most common integrity problems are: <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">A. Plagiarism -- that is,
                presenting others' work as if it were your own -- and <br>
                B. Crediting others' work, but badly. <br>
              </div>
              To avoid both, follow the guidelines below. <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
              </div>
            </div>

                          own. "Another's work" includes their ideas and
                          the words they used to express their ideas.
                          Therefore, to avoid plagiarizing:</span><br>

                            plagiarizing. Either put the material in

                  inaccurate. Use the notes to help yourself understand

                besides class and assigned texts or videos, I don't
                require a "works cited" page. But if you use any outside

                  qualified to write about your topic, you probably
                  should not use that source. When in doubt, either ask
                  me or do not use the source.<br>

                  the parenthetical citations/reference list style. In
                  other words, cite an outside source in parentheses --
                  like (Miyazaki, 247) -- wherever you use it in your
                  work, and provide a bibliography. You must include the

                probably need to say more. If you end up at 1500+ words,

                    That is, quote a premise from the text, then explain
                    for yourself what it means, then quote some more and
                    explain that, and so on until you've shown how the
                    whole argument works. For any conclusions, explain
                    how they're supposed to follow from the premises.</li>

                  argument doesn't have to mean showing the argument is
                  bad. Maybe it turns out the argument is good--or at
                  least that some objection(s) fail to show it's bad.
                  There are many ways a paper can go. Here are some you
                  might try:</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <ol>
                  <li>Here's the argument. Here's an objection. Here's
                    why the objection shows the argument is bad. The
                    end. <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Here's the argument. Here's an objection. The
                    objection, though, fails to show the argument is
                    bad. So, the argument is immune to that objection. <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Here's the argument. Here's an objection. Here's
                    why this objection fails. But wait, here's another
                    objection, and it succeeds. So the argument is bad.</li>
                  <li>Here's an argument. Here's an objection. Oh, and
                    here's another. But here's why they both fail to
                    show the argument is bad. So the argument is immune
                    to both those objections.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Of these (1-4), #1 and #2 are OK, but #3 and #4 show
                  more sophistication, which is even better.<br>
                  <br>
