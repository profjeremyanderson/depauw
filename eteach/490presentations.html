                  of, summarizing, such as... <br>

              <li><font size="-1">Explain why you think the material is

                  some central issue that is unresolved, or resolved in
                  a way we might disagree with. <br>
                </font></li>

                  (For some reason, pointing to errors often works
                  better. You might contrast an author's view with a
                  differing view you think is very plausible, or point
                  out some fallacy in the text, or point to some
                  unattractive consequence(s) of the author's view.)<br>

              <li><font size="-1">Point us to some key passage(s) in the
                  text for us to explore. (A passage may be of interest
                  because it expresses an important point and/or is
                  provocative, like Machiavelli's story of Cesare Borgia
                  and Remiro d'Orco.) <br>

                  real, example to illustrate, explore, or criticize
                  what an author says. (Since we're talking a lot about
                  things we all have some experience of--war, love,
                  moral judgment--it's fair to consider how things might

                  </span>If you'd like to raise a series of questions or
                  points for the class to discuss, raising them all at
                  once might not be best. Instead, you could raise one,
                  have us talk about it, raise another, and so on<br>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">As you
                prepare, keep in mind that your job is to set the tone
                and topic(s) of discussion for the day, and this
                discussion might turn out to be the class' only
                examination of a particular text. <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">So be sure to direct us
                  towards what matters most.</span> Ask yourself, "If
                the class only comes away discussing a couple of things

              </font><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And since

                text--try to do your spiel in a way that provokes,
                invites, or at least does not quash discussion. Some

                  (You may try to do that during the ensuing

              <font size="-1">You'll present your ideas for your
                research paper to the class. This assignment is meant to
                accomplish three things.&nbsp; First, to get you
                thinking about your research paper long before it is
                due. Second, to give you early feedback about your
                topic.&nbsp; Third, for you to practice explaining
                philosophical ideas to a non-philosophical
                audience.&nbsp; In line with the third goal, when
                preparing your presentation you should have in mind an
                audience of people who are intelligent, intellectually
                curious, but unfamiliar with philosophy and somewhat
                skeptical about its worth.&nbsp; </font><br>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">Here&#8217;s one
                way you might think of it: Suppose you were hanging out
                with the parents of your significant other and had about
                fifteen minutes to kill, and one of them casually asked
                you, &#8220;So, what are you writing your big philosophy paper
                on?&#8221;&nbsp; (For this to work, assume that the parents in
                question are not complete idiots/jerks.&nbsp; If
                necessary, please adjust your thought experiment
                accordingly).</font><br>

              <font size="-1">You will be on the spot for 15-20 minutes.
                Roughly the first five minutes of your time should
                consist of you explaining the topic of your paper in
                general terms and providing some specifics about at
                least one of the main issues, questions, puzzles,
                arguments, etc. that you plan to discuss in your
                paper.&nbsp; At this early stage you do not need to have
                the entire paper planned out or know what your ultimate
                conclusion will be, but you should have a good grip on
                at least one of the central issues you will take up in
                the paper.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Your
                  mission is to lay out one of these issues in a
                  compelling way; show us why this issue is worth
                  thinking about.</span>&nbsp; As when instigating
                discussion of a reading, you may use notes or an
                outline, but do not simply read to the class.&nbsp; You
                are free to use props (e.g. handouts, PowerPoint) this
                time around if you like, but props are not at all
                necessary.&nbsp; Please use them <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">only </span>if they will
                help you better get your ideas across.&nbsp; </font><br>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">After your
                initial 5-minute presentation, you will field questions
                from your fellow students and professor for about 10-15
                minutes.&nbsp; The best way to prepare for this brief
                question-and-answer period is to have a clear grasp of
                your topic and its importance.</font><br>

              <font size="-1">Because of the number of students we have
                (at least on Wednesday April 8), it is important that
                these presentation/discussions be limited to about 20
                minutes and occur one right after the other.&nbsp; This
                means that you should use your time well. You should
                plan and rehearse what you want to say. </font><br>
              <br>
              <font size="-1">Any set-up time counts as part of your
                allotted time.&nbsp; This is something to keep in mind
                when making decisions about using props; if you have to
                spend five minutes fussing with some piece of equipment
                before you begin, this will have a negative impact on
                your grade.&nbsp; You must rule technology; don&#8217;t let
                technology rule you.</font><br>

                professional philosophy conference: a speaker will
                present his or her paper (15 minutes), a second speaker
                will comment on the paper (5 minutes), and then we will
                open the floor to questions from the audience (10
                minutes). The goals here include: To practice presenting
                and discussing complex philosophical issues orally and
                to receive feedback from classmates on a complete draft
                of your final paper before it is due so that your final
                paper will be even better than it would otherwise have
                been.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

              </font><font size="-1">As speaker, your central mission is
                to explain the thesis and central argument(s) of your
                paper to the audience in a clear, well-organized,
                easy-to-follow fashion. You may use whatever props you
                think are helpful in this endeavor; a good handout can
                go a long way, particularly if you will refer repeatedly
                to quotations, principles, or arguments. You may use
                notes. <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:
                  italic;">However, you shall not under any
                  circumstances simply read from your paper or anything
                  else. </span>Your presentation should be roughly
                fifteen minutes in length. This is a challenging task.
                To do it well will require substantial preparation
                (beyond simply writing a good paper). Practicing in
                advance is strongly recommended. You may also want to
                make use of the &#8220;S&#8221; center. Presenting complex
                philosophical ideas orally is quite different from
                presenting them in writing; sentences that make sense on
                the written page can be difficult to grasp when spoken
                aloud. So the way in which you present your ideas in the
                talk may differ from the way you do in the paper.</font><br>

                paper, and each of you will present prepared comments on
                a classmate's paper. When you serve as commentator, your
                central mission is to provide a brief (five minute)
                commentary on the speaker&#8217;s paper that stimulates both
                the speaker and the audience to think more deeply about
                the speaker&#8217;s ideas. One good way to do this is to
                provide constructive criticism of the speaker&#8217;s
                arguments. </font><br>
              <br>
              <font size="-1">Just as the speaker should provide you
                with a draft of his or her paper in a timely fashion,
                you should read and think about that paper in a timely
                fashion. Depending on the nature of the paper in
                question, you may want to do additional reading in
                preparing your comments. Reading the paper the morning
                of the presentation and spewing out a few half-assed
                questions is neither appropriate nor a way to pass this
                assignment. Instead, you'll provide the speaker with
                some idea of the direction of your comments the evening
                prior to the talk. The goal here is not to spring a
                devastating objection upon your hapless speaker but
                rather to stimulate him or her to write a better paper.</font><br>
              <br>
              <font size="-1">It is likely you will have comments on
                "big" issues, such as whether the paper's main points
                are clear and whether its arguments are sound, but also
                "small" issues such as matters of style. When you
                present your comments in front of the class, focus most
                on the big issues, either leaving the small ones for
                last if there is time, or e-mailing them to the paper's
                author. </font><br>

                views and arguments of your classmates and professor is
                appropriate and encouraged, but should always be done in
                a courteous and respectful way. Courtesy and respect
                range from the way speaker and commentator interact
                prior to the presentation (e.g., providing the speaker
                with a sense of your main criticisms in advance rather
                than springing them on him or her with no warning) to
                the way in which the criticisms are presented (e.g.,
                &#8220;One possible problem with Anderson's argument is that
                P&#8221; rather than &#8220;Anderson has obviously overlooked P,
                which decisively refutes his position; it&#8217;s hard to
