                (5 minutes max), and then we will open the floor to
                questions from the audience (~10-15 minutes; 20-30
                minutes total per paper). The goals here include: To
                practice presenting and discussing complex philosophical
                issues orally and to receive feedback from classmates on
                a complete draft of your final paper before it is due so
                that your final paper will be even better than it would

              </font><font size="-1">Your goal is to explain the thesis
                and central argument(s) of your paper to the audience in
                a clear, well-organized, easy-to-follow way. You may use
                whatever props you think are helpful; a good handout can
                go a long way, particularly if you will refer repeatedly
                to quotations, principles, or arguments. You may use
                notes. <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:
                  italic;">However, you may not simply read from your
                  paper or anything else. </span>Your presentation
                should be at least 10 but no more than 15 minutes long.
                This is challenging. To do it well will require
                substantial preparation beyond simply writing a good
                paper. Practicing in advance is strongly recommended.
                You may also want to make use of the &#8220;S&#8221; center.
                Presenting complex philosophical ideas orally is quite
                different from presenting them in writing; sentences
                that make sense on the written page can be difficult to
                grasp when spoken aloud. So the way you present your
                ideas in the talk may differ from how you it do in the
                paper.</font><br>

              </font><font size="-1">Each of you will present your
                paper, and each of you will present prepared comments on
                a classmate's paper. When you serve as commentator, your
                central mission is to provide a brief (5 minutes max)
                commentary on the speaker&#8217;s paper that stimulates both
                the speaker and the audience to think more deeply about
                the speaker&#8217;s ideas. One good way to do this is to
                provide constructive criticism of the speaker&#8217;s
                arguments. </font><br>
              <br>
              <font size="-1">Just as the speaker should provide you
                with a draft of his or her paper in a timely fashion,
                you should read and think about that paper in a timely
                fashion. Depending on the nature of the paper in
                question, you may want to do additional reading in
                preparing your comments. Reading the paper the morning
                before the presentation and spewing out a few half-assed
                questions is neither appropriate nor a way to pass this
                assignment. Instead, provide the speaker with some idea
                of the direction of your comments the evening prior to
                the talk. The goal here is not to spring a devastating
                objection upon your hapless speaker but rather to
                stimulate them to write a better paper.</font><br>
              <br>
              <font size="-1">It is likely you will have comments on
                "big" issues, such as whether the paper's main points
                are clear and whether its arguments are sound, but also
                "small" issues like matters of style. When you present
                your comments in front of the class, focus on the big
                issues, and e-mail the smaller ones to the paper's
                author and the instructor. </font><br>

              </font><font size="-1">Questioning and criticizing the
                views and arguments of your classmates and professor is
                appropriate and encouraged, but should always be done in
                a courteous and respectful way. Courtesy and respect
                range from the way speaker and commentator interact
                prior to the presentation (e.g., providing the speaker
                with a sense of your main criticisms in advance rather
                than springing them on them with no warning) to the way
                in which the criticisms are presented (e.g., &#8220;One
                possible problem with Anderson's argument is that P&#8221;
                rather than &#8220;Anderson has obviously overlooked P, which
                decisively refutes his position; it&#8217;s hard to believe
                that anyone could make such an embarrassing blunder; but
                Anderson has did&#8221;).</font><br>
