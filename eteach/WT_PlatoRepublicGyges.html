                      Socrates is speaking in the first person. He tells
                      the story of a (very, very long) conversation he
                      had about justice one night. </font><br>
                    <font size="-1"> </font><br>
                    <font size="-1"> Here is what's happening as we
                      begin Book II. A man named Thrasymachus has just
                      argued that justice is a fraud. Socrates debated
                      Thrasymachus. As often happens when people
                      disagree with Socrates, Thrasymachus eventually
                      found himself unable to defend his view.
                      Embarrassed, he fell silent. </font><br>
                    <font size="-1"> </font><br>
                    <font size="-1"> As we begin this passage, Glaucon
                      (who is actually Socrates' friend) believes
                      Socrates has not adequately responded to
                      Thrasymachus' argument. Merely getting
                      Thrasymachus to shut up does not show that
                      Socrates is right; it does not show that justice
                      is really a most valuable thing, as Socrates
                      claims it is. </font><br>
                    <font size="-1"> </font><br>
                    <font size="-1"> So, in this reading, Glaucon
                      challenges Socrates to make a better argument for
                      justice. Glaucon says "the many" (that is, most
                      people) believe justice is something we tolerate
                      but don't really like: that behaving ourselves is
                      something we do as a sort of chore; we do it
                      because we can't get away with doing what we'd <span
                        style="font-style: italic;">really</span> like
                      to do. </font><br>
                    <font size="-1"> </font><br>
                    <font size="-1"> To dramatize this point, Glaucon
                      uses an old story of a shepherd who found a magic
                      ring that enables him to become invisible, and
                      thereby do whatever he wants without getting
                      caught. (If you think this sounds like <span
                        style="font-style: italic;">The Lord of the
                        Rings</span>, you're right.)</font><br>
                    <font size="-1"> </font><br>
                    <font size="-1"> Of course you should wonder: What
                      would you do if you had such a ring--or, more
                      broadly, the ability to do whatever you pleased,
                      with no accountability? <br>

                      film, Phil the weatherman (for reasons never
                      explained) finds himself re-living Groundhog Day
                      over, and over, and over, and over again. He
                      begins to realize that no matter what he does
                      during the day, the next morning he will wake up
                      in the same bed, just as he had yesterday. That's
                      because it <span style="font-style: italic;">is </span>yesterday:
                      the same annoying song will awaken him at the same
                      time in the morning in the same B&amp;B bedroom,
                      the people in the town will behave exactly has
                      they had the previous day, the weather will be the
                      same, Phil and others do not age, and so on. He
                      will remember what happened the previous day but
                      no-one else will. No matter what he does, the
                      consequences of it will disappear and the entire
                      universe, except for Phil's memory, will be reset

                      of Gyges, it is somewhat similar: Phil's actions,
                      whether good or bad, will become "invisible" to
                      everyone else the next morning. Even when he is
                      caught and jailed after some extreme joyriding, he

                  <font size="-1"><br>
                    With these words I [Socrates] was thinking that I
                    had made an end of the discussion [with
                    Thrasymachus, and proven that justice is better than
                    injustice]; but the end, in truth, proved to be only
                    a beginning. For Glaucon, who is always the most
                    pugnacious of men, was dissatisfied at Thrasymachus'
                    retirement; he wanted to have the battle out. So he
                    said to me: Socrates, do you wish really to persuade
                    us, or only to seem to have persuaded us, that to be
                    just is always better than to be unjust?<br>
                    <br>
                    I should wish really to persuade you, I replied, if
                    I could.<br>
                    <br>
                    Then you certainly have not succeeded. Let me ask
                    you now: --How would you arrange goods --are there
                    not some which we welcome for their own sakes, and
                    independently of their consequences, as, for
                    example, harmless pleasures and enjoyments, which
                    delight us at the time, although nothing follows
                    from them?<br>
                    <br>
                    I agree in thinking that there is such a class, I
                    replied.<br>
                    <br>
                    Is there not also a second class of goods, such as
                    knowledge, sight, health, which are desirable not
                    only in themselves, but also for their results?<br>
                    <br>
                    Certainly, I said.<br>
                    <br>
                    And would you not recognize a third class, such as
                    gymnastic [exercise], and the care of the sick, and
                    the physician's art; also the various ways of
                    money-making --these do us good but we regard them
                    as disagreeable; and no one would choose them for
                    their own sakes, but only for the sake of some
                    reward or result which flows from them?<br>
                    <br>
                    There is, I said, this third class also. But why do
                    you ask?<br>
                    <br>
                    Because I want to know in which of the three classes
                    you would place justice?<br>
                    <br>
                    In the highest class, I replied, --among those goods
                    which he who would be happy desires both for their
                    own sake and for the sake of their results.<br>
                    <br>
                    Then the many are of another mind; they think that
                    justice is to be reckoned in the troublesome class,
                    among goods which are to be pursued for the sake of
                    rewards and of reputation, but in themselves are
                    disagreeable and rather to be avoided.<br>
                    <br>
                    I know, I said, that this is their manner of
                    thinking, and that this was the thesis which
                    Thrasymachus was maintaining just now, when he
                    censured justice and praised injustice. But I am too
                    stupid to be convinced by him.<br>
                    <br>
                    I wish, he said, that you would hear me as well as
                    him, and then I shall see whether you and I agree.
                    For Thrasymachus seems to me, like a snake, to have
                    been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to
                    have been; but to my mind the nature of justice and
                    injustice have not yet been made clear. Setting
                    aside their rewards and results, I want to know what
                    they are in themselves, and how they inwardly work
                    in the soul.<br>
                    <br>
                    If you please, then, I will revive the argument of
                    Thrasymachus. And first I will speak of the nature
                    and origin of justice according to the common view
                    of them. Secondly, I will show that all men who
                    practise justice do so against their will, of
                    necessity, but not as a good. And thirdly, I will
                    argue that there is reason in this view, for the
                    life of the unjust is after all better far than the
                    life of the just --if what they say is true,
                    Socrates, since I myself am not of their opinion.
                    But still I acknowledge that I am perplexed when I
                    hear the voices of Thrasymachus and myriads of
                    others dinning in my ears; and, on the other hand, I
                    have never yet heard the superiority of justice to
                    injustice maintained by any one in a satisfactory
                    way. I want to hear justice praised in respect of
                    itself; then I shall be satisfied, and you are the
                    person from whom I think that I am most likely to
                    hear this. Therefore I will praise the unjust life
                    to the utmost of my power, and my manner of speaking
                    will indicate the manner in which I desire to hear
                    you too praising justice and censuring injustice.
                    Will you say whether you approve of my proposal?<br>
                    <br>
                    Indeed I do; nor can I imagine any theme about which
                    a man of sense would oftener wish to converse.<br>
                    <br>
                    I am delighted, he replied, to hear you say so, and
                    shall begin by speaking, as I proposed, of the
                    nature and origin of justice.<br>
                    <br>
                    [Glaucon continues:] They say that to do injustice
                    is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice, evil; but
                    that the evil is greater than the good. And so when
                    men have both done and suffered injustice and have
                    had experience of both, not being able to avoid the
                    one and obtain the other, they think that they had
                    better agree among themselves to have neither; hence
                    there arise laws and mutual covenants; and that
                    which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful
                    and just. This they affirm to be the origin and
                    nature of justice; --it is a mean or compromise,
                    between the best of all, which is to do injustice
                    and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is
                    to suffer injustice without the power of
                    retaliation; and justice, being at a middle point
                    between the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as
                    the lesser evil, and honoured by reason of the
                    inability of men to do injustice. For no man who is
                    worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such
                    an agreement if he were able to resist; he would be
                    mad if he did. Such is the received account,
                    Socrates, of the nature and origin of justice.<br>
                    <br>
                    Now that those who practise justice do so
                    involuntarily and because they have not the power to
                    be unjust will best appear if we imagine something
                    of this kind: having given both to the just and the
                    unjust power to do what they will, let us watch and
                    see whither desire will lead them; then we shall
                    discover in the very act the just and unjust man to
                    be proceeding along the same road, following their
                    interest, which all natures deem to be their good,
                    and are only diverted into the path of justice by
                    the force of law. The liberty which we are supposing
                    may be most completely given to them in the form of
                    such a power as is said to have been possessed by
                    Gyges the ancestor of Croesus the Lydian.<br>
                    <br>
                    According to the tradition, Gyges was a shepherd in
                    the service of the king of Lydia; there was a great
                    storm, and an earthquake made an opening in the
                    earth at the place where he was feeding his flock.
                    Amazed at the sight, he descended into the opening,
                    where, among other marvels, he beheld a hollow
                    brazen horse, having doors, at which he stooping and
                    looking in saw a dead body of stature, as appeared
                    to him, more than human, and having nothing on but a
                    gold ring; this he took from the finger of the dead
                    and reascended. Now the shepherds met together,
                    according to custom, that they might send their
                    monthly report about the flocks to the king; into
                    their assembly he came having the ring on his
                    finger, and as he was sitting among them he chanced
                    to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand, when
                    instantly he became invisible to the rest of the
                    company and they began to speak of him as if he were
                    no longer present. He was astonished at this, and
                    again touching the ring he turned the collet
                    outwards and reappeared; he made several trials of
                    the ring, and always with the same result-when he
                    turned the collet inwards he became invisible, when
                    outwards he reappeared. Whereupon he contrived to be
                    chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the
                    court; where as soon as he arrived he seduced the
                    queen, and with her help conspired against the king
                    and slew him, and took the kingdom.<br>
                    <br>
                    Suppose now that there were two such magic rings,
                    and the just put on one of them and the unjust the
                    other; no man can be imagined to be of such an iron
                    nature that he would stand fast in justice. No man
                    would keep his hands off what was not his own when
                    he could safely take what he liked out of the
                    market, or go into houses and lie with any one at
                    his pleasure, or kill or release from prison whom he
                    would, and in all respects be like a god among men.
                    Then the actions of the just [man who had such a
                    ring] would be [as bad] as the actions of the unjust
                    [man who had such a ring]; they would both come at
                    last to the same point.<br>
                    <br>
                    And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof
                    that a man is just, not willingly or because he
                    thinks that justice is any good to him individually,
                    but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks that
                    he can safely be unjust, there he is unjust. For all
                    men believe in their hearts that injustice is far
                    more profitable to the individual than justice, and
                    he who argues as I have been supposing, will say
                    that they are right. If you could imagine any one
                    obtaining this power of becoming invisible, and
                    never doing any wrong or touching what was
                    another's, he would be thought by the lookers-on to
                    be a most wretched idiot, although they would praise
                    him to one another's faces, and keep up appearances
                    with one another from a fear that they too might
                    suffer injustice.<br>
