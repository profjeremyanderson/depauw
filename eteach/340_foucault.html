<p>On 1 March 1757 Damiens the regicide was condemned "to make the
<i>amende
honorable</i> before the main door of the Church of Paris," where he
was
to be "taken and conveyed in a cart, wearing nothing but a shirt,
holding
a torch of burning wax weighing two pounds"; then, "in the said cart,
to
the Place de Gr&egrave;ve, where, on a scaffold that will be erected
there,
the flesh will be torn from his breasts, arms, thighs and claves with
red-hot
pincers, his right hand, holding the knife with which he committed the
said parricide, burnt with sulphur, and, on those places where the
flesh
will be torn away, poured molten lead, boiling oil, burning resin, wax
and sulphur melted together and then his body drawn and quartered by
four
horses and his limbs and body consumed by fire, reduced to ashes and
his
ashes thrown to the winds" (<i>Pi&egrave;ces originales</i>..., 372-4).
</p>
<p>"Finally, he was quartered," recounts the <i>Gazette d'Amsterdam</i>
of 1 April 1757. "This last operation was very long, because the horses
used were not accustomed to drawing; consequently, instead of four, six
were needed; and when that did not suffice, they were forced, in order
to cut off the wretch's thighs, to sever the sinews and hack at the
joints...
</p>
<p>"It is said that, though he was always a great swearer, no blashemy
escaped his lips; but the excessive pain made him utter horrible cries,
and he often repeated: 'My God, have pity on me! Jesus, help me!' The
spectators
were all edified by the solicitude of the parish priest of St Paul's
who
despite his great age did not spare himself in offering consolation to
the patient."
</p>
<p>Bouton, an officer of the watch, left us his account: "The sulphur
was
lit, but the flame was so poor that only the top skin of the hand was
burnt,
and that only slightly. Then the executioner, his sleeves rolled up,
took
the steel pincers, which had been especially made for the occasion, and
which were about a foot and a half long, and pulled first at the calf
of
the right leg, then at the thigh, and from there at the two fleshy
parts
of the right arm; then at the breasts. Though a strong, sturdy fellow,
this executioner found it so difficult to tear away the pieces of flesh
that he set about the same spot two or three times, twisting the
pincers
as he did so, and what he took away formed at each part a wound about
the
size of a six-pound crown piece.
</p>
<p>"After these tearings with the pincers, Damiens, who cried out
profusely,
though without swearing, raised his head and looked at himself; the
same
executioner dipped an iron spoon in the pot containing the boiling
potion,
which he poured liberally over each wound. Then the ropes that were to
be harnessed to the horses were attached with cords to the patient's
body;
the horses were then harnessed and placed alongside the arms and legs,
one at each limb.
</p>
<p>"Monsieur Le Breton, the clerk of the court, went up to the patient
several times and asked him if he had anything to say. He said he had
not;
at each torment, he cried out, as the damned in hell are supposed to
cry
out, 'Pardon, my God! Pardon, my Lord.' Despite all this pain, he
raised
his head from time to time and looked at himself boldly. The cords had
been tied so tightly by the men who pulled the ends that they caused
him
indescribable pain. Monsieur le [sic] Breton went up to him again and
asked
him if he had anything to say; he said no. Several confessors went up
to
him and spoke to him at length; he willingly kissed the crucifix that
was
held out to him; he opened his lips and repeated: 'Pardon, Lord.'
</p>
<p>"The horses tugged hard, each pulling straight on a limb, each horse
held by an executioner. After a quarter of an hour, the same ceremony
was
repeated and finally, after several attempts, the direction of the
horses
had to be changed, thus: those at the arms were made to pull towards
the
head, those at the thighs towards the arms, which broke the arms at the
joints. This was repeated several times without success. He raised his
head and looked at himself. Two more horses had to be added to those
harnessed
to the thighs, which made six horses in all. Without success.
</p>
<p>"Finally, the executioner, Samson, said to Monsieur Le Breton that
there
was no way or hope of succeeding, and told him to ask their Lordships
if
they wished him to have the prisoner cut into pieces. Monsieur Le
Breton,
who had come down from the town, ordered that renewed efforts be made,
and this was done; but the horses gave up and one of those harnessed to
the thighs fell to the ground. The confessors returned and spoke to him
again. He said to them (I heard him): 'Kiss me, gentlemen.' The parish
priest of St Paul's did not dare to, so Monsieur de Marsilly slipped
under
the rope holding the left arm and kissed him on the forehead. The
executioners
gathered round and Damiens told them not to swear, to carry out their
task
and that he did not think ill of them; he begged them to pray to God
for
him, and asked the parish priest of St Paul's to pray for him at the
first
mass.
</p>
<p>"After two or three attempts, the executioner Samson and he who had
used the pincers each drew out a knife from his pocket and cut the body
at the thighs instead of severing the legs at the joints; the four
horses
gave a tug and carried off the two thighs after them, namely, that of
the
right side first, the other following; then the same was done to the
arms,
the shoulders, the arm-pits and the four limbs; the flesh had to be cut
almost to the bone, the horses pulling hard carried off the right arm
first
and the other afterwards.
</p>
<p>"When the four limbs had been pulled away, the confessors came to
speak
to him; but his executioner told them that he was dead, though the
truth
was that I saw the man move, his lower jaw moving from side to side as
if he were talking. One of the executioners even said shortly
afterwards
that when they had lifted the trunk to throw it on the stake, he was
still
alive. The four limbs were untied from the ropes and thrown on the
stake
set up in the enclosure in line with the scaffold, then the trunk and
the
rest were covered with logs and faggots, and fire was put to the straw
mixed with this wood.
</p>
<p>"...In accordance with the decree, the whole was reduced to ashes.
The
last piece to be found in the embers was still burning at half-past ten
in the evening. The pieces of flesh and the trunk had taken about four
hours to burn. The officers of whom I was one, as also was my son, and
a detachment of archers remained in the square until nearly eleven
o'clock.
</p>
<p>"There were those who made something of the fact that a dog had lain
the day before on the grass where the fire had been, had been chased
away
several times, and had always returned. But it is not difficult to
understand
that an animal found this place warmer than elsewhere" (quoted in
Zevaes,
201-14).<img src="340_school.jpeg" alt="school" x-sas-useimagewidth=""

</p>
<p>Eighty years later, L&eacute;on Faucher drew up his rules "for the
House
of young prisoners in Paris":
</p>
<p>"Art. 17. The prisoners' day will begin at six in the morning in
winter
and at five in summer. They will work for nine hours a day throughout
the
year. Two hours a day will be devoted to instruction. Work and the day
will end at nine o'clock in winter and at eight in summer.
</p>
<p>Art. 18. <i>Rising</i>. At the first drum-roll, the prisoners must
rise
and dress in silence, as the supervisor opens the cell doors. At the
second
drum-roll, they must be dressed and make their beds. At the third, they
must line up and proceed to the chapel for morning prayer. There is a
five-minute
interval between each drum-roll.
</p>
<p>Art. 19. The prayers are conducted by the chaplain and followed by a
moral or religious reading. This exercise must not last more than half
an hour.
</p>
<p>Art. 20. <i>Work</i>. At a quarter to six in the summer, a quarter
to
seven in winter, the prisoners go down into the courtyard where they
must
wash their hands and faces, and receive their first ration of bread.
Immediately
afterwards, they form into work-teams and go off to work, which must
begin
at six in summer and seven in winter.
</p>
<p>Art. 21. <i>Meal</i>. At ten o'clock the prisoners leave their work
and go to the refectory; they wash their hands in their courtyards and
assemble in divisions. After the dinner, there is recreation until
twenty
minutes to eleven.
</p>
<p>Art. 22. <i>School</i>. At twenty minutes to eleven, at the
drum-roll,
the prisoners form into ranks, and proceed in divisions to the school.
The class lasts two hours and consists alternately of reading, writing,
drawing and arithmetic.
</p>
<p>Art. 23. At twenty minutes to one, the prisoners leave the school,
in
divisions, and return to their courtyards for recreation. At five
minutes
to one, at the drum-roll, they form into workteams.<img

 x-sas-useimageheight="" style="height: 397px; width: 292px;" title=""
 align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">
</p>
<p>Art. 24. At one o'clock they must be back in the workshops: they
work
until four o'clock.
</p>
<p>Art. 25. At four o'clock the prisoners leave their workshops and go
into the courtyards where they wash their hands and form into divisions
for the refectory.
</p>
<p>Art. 26. Supper and the recreation that follows it last until five
o'clock:
the prisoners then return to the workshops.
</p>
<p>Art. 27. At seven o'clock in the summer, at eight in winter, work
stops;
bread is distributed for the last time in the workshops. For a quarter
of an hour one of the prisoners or supervisors reads a passage from
some
instructive or uplifting work. This is followed by evening prayer.
</p>
<p>Art. 28. At half-past seven in summer, half-past eight in winter,
the
prisoners must be back in their cells after the washing of hands and
the
inspection of clothes in the courtyard; at the first drum-roll, they
must
undress, and at the second get into bed. The cell doors are closed and
the supervisors go the rounds in the corridors, to ensure order and
silence"
(Faucher, 274, 82).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>We have, then, a public execution and a time-table. They do not
punish
the same crimes or the same type of delinquent. But they each define a
certain penal style. Less than a century separates them. It was a time
when, in Europe and in the United States, the entire economy of
punishment
was redistributed. It was a time of great "scandals" for traditional
justice,
a time of innumerable projects for reform. It saw a new theory of law
and
crime, a new moral or political justification of the right to punish;
old
laws were abolished, old customs died out. "Modern" codes were planned
or drawn up: Russia, 1769; Prussia, 1780; Pennsylvania and Tuscany,
1786;
Austria, 1788; France, 1791, Year IV, 1808 and 1810. It was a new age
for
penal justice.
</p>
<p>Among so many changes, I shall consider one: the disappearance of
torture
as a public spectacle. Today we are rather inclined to ignore it;
perhaps,
in its time, it gave rise to too much inflated rhetoric; perhaps it has
been attributed too readily and too emphatically to a process of
"humanization",
thus dispensing with the need for further analysis. And, in any case,
how
important is such a change, when compared with the great institutional
transformations, the formulation of explicit, general codes and unified
rules of procedure; with the almost universal adoption of the jury
system,
the definition of the essentially corrective character of the penalty
and
the tendency, which has become increasingly marked since the nineteenth
century, to adapt punishment to the individual offender? Punishment of
a less immediately physical kind, a certain discretion in the art of
inflicting
pain, a combination of more subtle, more subdued sufferings, deprived
of
their visible display, should not all this be treated as a special
case,
an incidental effect of deeper changes? And yet the fact remains that a
few decades saw the disappearance of the tortured, dismembered,
amputated
body, symbolically branded on face or shoulder, exposed alive or dead
to
public view. The body as the major target of penal repression
disappeared.
