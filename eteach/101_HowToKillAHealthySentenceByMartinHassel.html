            1. <b>Begin with a sentence that is clear and direct:</b><br>
            To think clearly, write clearly.<br>
            <br>
            2. <b>Change its verbs, adjectives, and adverbs into
              abstract nouns:</b><br>
            For clarity of thought, seek clarity of writing.<br>
            <br>
            3. <b>Make the sentence passive:</b><br>
            For clarity of thought, clarity of writing should be sought.<br>
            <br>
            4. <b>Use two words where one would do:</b><br>
            For mental process clarity, prose expression clarity should
            be looked for.<br>
            <br>
            5. <b>Use plenty of 'in regard to' and 'as to':</b><br>
            For clarity in regard to mental processes, clarity as to
            prose expression should be looked for.<br>
            <br>
            6. <b>Sprinkle with words that do not add anything:</b><br>
            For there ever to be any kind of clarity in regard to mental
            processes, the most fundamental and basic end goal of
            clarity as to prose expression definitely ought to be looked
            for to the greatest extent that is possible by every writer.<br>
            <br>
            7. <b>Put everything in the negative:</b><br>
            For there to be no lack of clarity in regard to mental
            processes, the most fundamental and basic end goal of
            clarity
            in regard to prose expression definitely ought not to be
            overlooked to the greatest extent that is not at all
            impossible
            by all writers.<br>
            <br>
            8. <b>Repeat the preceding steps. (Several times):</b><br>
            In regard to the issue of clarity, there is no lack of
            certainty that if there is to be successful avoidance of
            unclarity in
            regard to inward mental cognitive activity situation, the
            basic and fundamental end goal and objective of clarity, in
            any, indeed in all, written prose expression attempts is not
            something that can be overlooked without danger or
            avoided to the greatest degree that is not at all
            impossible, without exception.<br>
