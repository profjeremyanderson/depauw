I teach under the assumption that</font><br>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="-1">Classroom time should be active as well as
passive. Students will learn better if encouraged not only to
understand but to evaluate, question, and possibly reject material
under discussion.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Courses should be set up so students retain
material after the course is over. </font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Exams should provide an opportunity to
learn and teach and not merely serve as evaluative tools, and they
should be constructed to allow depth as well as breadth.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Students should be given the tools needed
to succeed in the course. </font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Students&#8217; enthusiasm for technology is a
resource to take advantage of.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <font size="-1">My goals in teaching are not unusual but are
nevertheless important. I challenge students to: </font><br>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="-1">Think deeply and carefully about
philosophical issues. I especially encourage them to get past the easy
answer or glib response, take even uncomfortable ideas seriously, and
to appreciate the appeal and the weaknesses of both sides of an issue. </font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Become conversant with the tools and terms
of philosophy generally, as well as with the important ideas and
controversies that arise within a particular course&#8217;s subject matter.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">See the relevance of philosophy to their
lives. </font></li>
        <li><font size="-1">Enhance their writing and critical thinking
skills. </font></li>

      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><br>
Beyond the obvious&#8212;like assigning classic and contemporary
philosophical texts, lecturing on them, and discussing them&#8212;I rely on
the following.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Study questions
and exams. </span>Each week I create study questions covering what I
want students to remember. The questions may be as easy as defining the
term &#8216;argument&#8217; or as hard as evaluating Descartes&#8217; response to
Pyhrronian skepticism. These become the basis for the exams, which
consist solely of selections from the list of study questions.&nbsp;
Thus there is no mystery about what material is &#8220;fair game,&#8221; and I can
demand high-quality answers. Students are encouraged to retain material
by repeated study because every exam covers all previous material in
the course. This encourages them to practice writing, because many
questions call for short essays. </font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Technology. </span>I
create web pages for my courses which include the syllabus, schedule,
major assignment guidelines, study questions, and contact information
for reaching me. I also include materials such as sample answers to
study questions, supplemental readings, and links to many sites useful
for philosophical research. (Samples can be found elsewhere on this
site, starting from <a href="index.html">my home page</a>.) I notify
students by e-mail of new study
question postings, assignments, and announcements. I encourage them to
e-mail me with any questions or concerns. Often they will send me their
answers to study questions, which lets me see how they&#8217;re doing and
gives them direct feedback from me seven days a week.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Informality and
active learning. </span>For many students&#8212;especially those discovering
it for the first time&#8212;philosophy appears to be a highly artificial,
bizarre, and intimidating field. To overcome these first impressions I
strive to make philosophy accessible by generally using ordinary
language rather than philosophical jargon, by trying to get students to
see the issues that arise in the course as important in real life
rather than as purely intellectual curiosities, and by keeping my
manner comfortable and familiar. To keep students involved and keep me
apprised of how they&#8217;re doing, I require substantial participation. </font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Visual learning.
      </span>I make very heavy use of the blackboard or overheads,
writing out the main points in lecture or discussion as I go and
creating diagrams to organize information. This is important for
reaching students who are &#8220;visual learners,&#8221; and helps keep the pace of
the class from becoming too fast. I use prepared overheads or
PowerPoint to make more interesting graphics possible, but sparingly
because the more my presentation resembles a TV show, the more passive
my students may become. Also, the greater investment I make in teaching
the course a certain way, the less likely I am to innovate each time I
teach the course. </font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Presentations. </span>I
often have students create individual or small-group presentations.
This allows them to research whatever philosophical topic interests
them most, and gives them experience speaking before an audience. Best
of all, their presentations add wonderful breadth to the course because
their curiosity takes them in directions I would never have thought of.</font><br>

      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Recognition. </span>UC Irvine&#8217;s philosophy
department recognized me with its Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award.
At California State University, Long Beach I was rated &#8220;Excellent&#8221;
among their large staff of lecturers. The University of Redlands&#8217;
Instructional Technology Center invited me to present my web pages and
PowerPoint for faculty at Claremont McKenna College. After noticing
that several students had rated me their favorite professor, the
Associate Dean of Student Life at the University of Redlands solicited
my advice for new students, which now appears in the UofR&#8217;s <a
 href="http://mycms.redlands.edu/prebuilt/pdf/StudentLife/GuideforSuccess.pdf"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Guide for
Success</span></a>. </font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Students voting
with their feet. </span>There is little need for students to take more
than one course from me, given the number of philosophy faculty and the
range of courses available to fulfill majors and minors. Yet many do:
since my second year, many students in my introductory courses and many
if not most in my advanced courses have taken at least one class from
me before.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unsolicited
student comments:&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Prior to this class I wasn't going to
pursue philosophy at all, and now I plan to minor in it...and I would
like to thank you for that...for helping me find an interest.&#8221;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1">&#8220;Never had I wanted to take a philosophy class,
but now I am looking forward to taking more.&#8221;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1">&#8220;I took a Philosophy class at a University in New
York and I hated going to the class... but now this is my favorite
class that I am taking this semester. You make the class very
interesting and you know how to make things clear to us, which is very
helpful.&#8221;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1">&#8220;I really enjoyed the class and feel that I left
with a very comprehensive understanding of a number of important
philosophical topics.&#8221;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1">&#8220;If you do the work, show up, participate, and do
the study questions, a 4.0 is not too hard to achieve. Everything is
explained fully and Jeremy is always there to provide you further
assistance.&#8221;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1">&nbsp;&#8220;From my experience with you in three
different classes, over three years, and other various interactions,
you are not only a good person but a great professor with potential
only to get better. I truly mean that and if you ever need help with a
recommendation or whatever please don&#8217;t be shy and let me know.&#8221;</font><br>
